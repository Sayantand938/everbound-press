## Part 1 (Today)

The bedroom is strange. Not familiar. I don’t know where I am, how I got here. I don’t know how I’m going to get home.

I have spent the night here. I was woken by a woman’s voice – at first I thought she was in bed with me, but then realized she was reading the news on a radio alarm – and when I opened my eyes I found myself here. In this room I don’t recognize.

My eyes adjust and I look around in the near dark. A dressing gown hangs off the back of the wardrobe door – suitable for a woman, but one much older than me – and some dark trousers are folded neatly over a chair at the dressing table, but I can't see much else. The alarm clock looks complex, but I find a button and manage to silence it.

It is then that I hear a sudden sharp breath behind me and realize I am not alone. I turn round. I see an area of skin and dark hair, with some white hairs. A man. He has his left arm outside the covers and there is a gold band on the third finger of the hand. I try not to groan. So this one is not only old and grey, I think, but also married. Not only have I slept with a married man, but I have done so in what I am guessing is his home, in the bed he must usually share with his wife. I lie back to gather myself. I ought to be ashamed.

I wonder where the wife is. Do I need to worry about her coming back soon? I imagine her standing on the other side of the room, screaming, calling me names. I wonder how I will defend myself, if she does appear. But the man in the bed doesn't seem worried. He has turned over and keeps snoring.

I lie as still as possible. Usually I can remember how I end up in situations like this, but not today. There must have been a party, or a trip to a bar or a club. I must have been very drunk. Drunk enough that I don't remember anything. Drunk enough to have gone home with a man who has a wedding ring and hair on his back.

I gently fold back the covers as gently as I can and sit on the edge of the bed. First, I need to use the bathroom. I ignore the slippers at my feet – after all, sleeping with the husband is one thing, but I could never wear another woman’s shoes – and walk quietly barefoot onto the landing. I am aware that I am naked, afraid of choosing the wrong door, of bumping into a lodger or a teenage son. Feeling relieved, I see the bathroom door is slightly open and go in, locking it behind me.

I sit, use the toilet, flush it, and turn to wash my hands. I reach for the soap, but something is wrong. At first I can’t work out what it is, but then I see it. The hand gripping the soap does not look like mine. The skin is wrinkled, the nails are unpolished and bitten short and, like the man in the bed I have just left, the third finger wears a simple gold wedding ring.

I stare for a moment, then wiggle my fingers. The fingers of the hand holding the soap move also. I gasp, and the soap falls into the sink with a thud. I look up at the mirror.

The face I see looking back at me is not my own. The hair is flat and is cut much shorter than I wear it, the skin on the cheeks and under the chin hangs loosely, the lips are thin, the mouth turned downwards. I cry out, a silent gasp that would become a scream of shock if I let it, and then notice the eyes. The skin around them is lined, yes, but despite everything else, I can see that they are mine. The person in the mirror is me, but I am twenty years too old. Twenty-five. More.

This isn’t possible. Starting to shake, I hold onto the edge of the sink. Another scream starts in my chest, and this one comes out as a choked gasp. I step back, away from the mirror, and it is then that I see them. Photographs. Taped to the wall, to the mirror itself. Pictures, mixed with yellow sticky notes, written with felt-tip pen, damp and curling.

I pick one randomly. Christine, it says, and an arrow points to a photograph of me – this new me, this old me – in which I am sitting on a bench on a dock, next to a man. The name seems familiar, but only slightly, as if I am having to try hard to believe it is mine. In the photograph we are both smiling at the camera, holding hands. He is good-looking, and when I look closely I can see that it is the same man I slept with, the one I left in the bed. The word Ben is written beneath it, and next to it Your husband.

I gasp, and rip it off the wall. No, I think. No! It can’t be … I look quickly at the other pictures. They are all of me, and him. In one I am wearing an ugly dress and opening a present, in another both of us are wearing matching waterproof jackets and stand in front of a waterfall as a small dog sniffs around our feet. Next to it is a picture of me sitting beside him, sipping a glass of orange juice, wearing the dressing gown I have seen in the bedroom next door.

I step back further, until I feel cold tiles touching my back. It is then I get a small spark that feels like a memory. As my mind tries to focus on it, it disappears, like ashes in the wind, and I realize that in my life there is a then, a before, though before what I cannot say, and there is a now, and there is nothing between the two except a long, silent emptiness that has brought me here, to me and him, in this house.

I go back into the bedroom. I still have the picture in my hand – the one of me and the man I had woken up with – and I hold it in front of me.

‘What’s going on?’ I say. I am shouting; tears run down my face. The man is sitting up in bed, his eyes half closed. ‘Who are you?’

‘I’m your husband,’ he says. His face is sleepy, without any sign of being annoyed. He does not look at my naked body. ‘We’ve been married for years.’

‘What do you mean?’ I say. I want to run, but I have nowhere to go. ‘“Married for years”? What do you mean?’

He stands up. ‘Here,’ he says, and passes me the dressing gown, waiting while I put it on. He is wearing pyjama trousers that are too big and a white vest. He reminds me of my father.

‘We got married in nineteen eighty-five,’ he says. ‘Twenty-two years ago. You—’

‘What—?’ I feel the blood leave my face, the room starts to spin. A clock ticks, somewhere in the house, and it sounds as loud as a hammer. ‘But—’ He takes a step towards me. ‘How—?’

‘Christine, you’re forty-seven now,’ he says. I look at him, this stranger who is smiling at me. I don’t want to believe him, don’t want even to hear what he’s saying, but he continues. ‘You had head injuries,’ he says. ‘A bad accident. You had head injuries. You have problems remembering things.’

‘What things?’ I say, meaning, It can't be the last twenty-five years? ‘What things?’

He steps towards me again, coming towards me as if I am a scared animal. ‘Everything,’ he says. ‘Sometimes starting from your early twenties. Sometimes even earlier than that.’

My mind spins with dates and ages. I don’t want to ask, but know that I must. ‘When … when was my accident?’

He looks at me, and his face is a mixture of compassion and fear.

‘When you were twenty-nine …’

I close my eyes. Even though my mind tries to reject this information, I know, deep down, that it is true. I hear myself start to cry again, and as I do so, this man, Ben, comes over to where I am standing in the doorway. I feel his presence next to me, I do not move as he puts his arms around my waist, I do not resist as he pulls me close. He holds me. Together we rock gently, and I realize this movement feels familiar somehow. It makes me feel better.

‘I love you, Christine,’ he says, and though I know I am supposed to say that I love him too, I don’t. I say nothing. How can I love him? He is a stranger. Nothing makes sense. I want to know many things. How I got here, how I manage to survive. But I don’t know how to ask.

‘I’m scared,’ I say.

‘I know,’ he replies. ‘I know. But don’t worry, Chris. I’ll look after you. I’ll always look after you. You’ll be fine. Trust me.’

He says he will show me round the house. I feel calmer. I have put on some underwear and an old T-shirt he gave me, then put the robe over my shoulders. We go out on to the landing. ‘You’ve seen the bathroom,’ he says, opening the door next to it. ‘This is the office.’

There is a glass desk with what I guess is a computer, though it looks very small, almost like a toy. Next to it is a grey filing cabinet, above it a planner on the wall. Everything is neat and tidy. ‘I work in there, now and then,’ he says, closing the door. We cross the landing and he opens another door. A bed, a dressing table, more wardrobes. It looks almost the same as the room where I woke up. ‘Sometimes you sleep in here,’ he says, ‘when you feel like it. But usually you don’t like waking up alone. You panic when you can't figure out where you are.’ I nod. I feel like someone looking to rent a new flat. A possible housemate. ‘Let’s go downstairs.’

I follow him down. He shows me a living room – with a brown sofa and matching chairs, a flat screen TV on the wall which he tells me is a television – and a dining room and kitchen. None of it feels familiar. I feel nothing at all, not even when I see a framed photo of us on a sideboard. ‘There’s a garden out the back,’ he says and I look through the glass door that leads off the kitchen. It is just starting to get light, the night sky turning a dark blue, and I can see the shape of a large tree and a shed at the far end of the small garden, but not much else. I realize I don’t even know what part of the world we are in.

‘Where are we?’ I say.

He stands behind me. I can see us both, reflected in the glass. Me. My husband. Middle-aged.

‘North London,’ he replies. ‘Crouch End.’

I step back. Panic begins to rise. ‘Jesus,’ I say. ‘I don’t even know where I live …’

He takes my hand. ‘Don’t worry. You’ll be fine.’ I turn round to face him, to wait for him to tell me how I will be fine, but he doesn't. ‘Shall I make you your coffee?’

For a moment I resent him, but then say, ‘Yes. Yes, please.’ He fills a kettle. ‘Black, please,’ I say. ‘No sugar.’

‘I know,’ he says, smiling at me. ‘Want some toast?’

I say yes. He must know so much about me, yet still this feels like the morning after a one-night stand: breakfast with a stranger in his house, thinking about how soon it would be okay to leave, to go home.

But that’s the difference. Apparently this is my home.

‘I think I need to sit down,’ I say.

He looks up at me. ‘Go and sit yourself down in the living room,’ he says. ‘I’ll bring this through in a minute.’

I leave the kitchen.

A few moments later Ben follows me in. He gives me a book. ‘This is a scrapbook,’ he says. ‘It might help.’ I take it from him. It is covered in plastic that is supposed to look like old leather but doesn't, and has a red ribbon tied around it in a messy bow. ‘I’ll be back in a minute,’ he says, and leaves the room.

I sit on the sofa. The scrapbook weighs heavy in my lap. To look at it feels like prying. I remind myself that whatever is in there is about me, was given to me by my husband.

I untie the bow and open it randomly. A picture of me and Ben, looking much younger.

I close it quickly. I run my hands over the cover, quickly turn the pages. I must have to do this every day.

I can’t imagine it. I am certain there has been a terrible mistake, yet there can’t have been. The evidence is there – in the mirror upstairs, in the wrinkles on the hands that touch the book in front of me. I am not the person I thought I was when I woke this morning.

But who was that? I think. When was I that person, who woke in a stranger’s bed and thought only of escape? I close my eyes. I feel as though I am floating. Not connected. In danger of getting lost.

I need to ground myself. I close my eyes and try to focus on something solid, anything. I find nothing. So many years of my life, I think. Missing.

This book will tell me who I am, but I don’t want to open it. Not yet. I want to sit here for a while, with the whole past a blank. In a state of uncertainty, balanced between what might be and what is real. I am afraid to discover my past. What I have achieved, and what I have not.

Ben comes back in and sets a tray in front of me. Toast, two cups of coffee, a jug of milk. ‘You OK?’ he says. I nod.

He sits beside me. He has shaved, dressed in trousers and a shirt and tie. He doesn't look like my father anymore. Now he looks as though he works in a bank, or an office. Not bad, I think, then push that thought away.

‘Is every day like this?’ I say.

He puts a piece of toast on a plate, spreads butter on it. ‘Pretty much,’ he says. ‘You want some?’ I shake my head and he takes a bite. ‘You seem to be able to remember information while you're awake,’ he says. ‘But then, when you sleep, most of it disappears. Is your coffee OK?’

I tell him it’s fine, and he takes the book from my hands. ‘This is a kind of scrapbook,’ he says, opening it. ‘We had a fire a few years ago so we lost a lot of the old photos and things, but there are still a few bits and pieces in here.’ He points to the first page. ‘This is your degree certificate,’ he says. ‘And here’s a photo of you on your graduation day.’ I look at where he points; I am smiling, looking into the sun with half-closed eyes, wearing a black gown and a felt hat with a gold string. Just behind me stands a man in a suit and tie, his head turned away from the camera.

‘That’s you?’ I say.

He smiles. ‘No. I didn’t graduate at the same time as you. I was still studying then. Chemistry.’

I look up at him. ‘When did we get married?’ I say.

He turns to face me, taking my hand in his. I am surprised by his rough skin, used, I suppose, to the soft skin of youth. ‘The year after you got your Ph.D. We had been dating for a few years by then, but we both wanted to wait until your studies were finished.’

That makes sense, I think, though it feels strangely practical of me. I wonder if I had been keen to marry him at all.

As if reading my mind he says, ‘We were very much in love,’ and then adds, ‘we still are.’

I can think of nothing to say. I smile. He takes a drink of his coffee before looking back at the book in his lap. He turns over some more pages.

‘You studied English,’ he says. ‘Then you had a few jobs, once you’d graduated. Just strange jobs. Secretarial work. Sales. I'm not sure you really knew what you wanted to do. I finished with a Bachelor of Science degree and trained to be a teacher. It was difficult for a few years, but then I was given a better job and, well, we ended up here.’

I look around the living room. It is smart, comfortable. Plainly middle class. A framed picture of a forest scene hangs on the wall above the fireplace, small china figures sit next to the clock on the mantelpiece. I wonder if I helped to choose the decor.

Ben goes on. ‘I teach in a secondary school nearby. I’m head of the department now.’ He says it without any sign of pride.

‘And me?’ I say, though really I know the only possible answer. He holds my hand tightly.

‘You had to stop working. After your accident. You don’t do anything.’ He must feel my disappointment. ‘You don’t need to. I earn enough money. We manage. We’re OK.’

I close my eyes, put my hand to my forehead. This feels like too much, and I want him to shut up. I feel as if there is only so much I can process, and if he keeps adding more, I will eventually feel overwhelmed.

What do I do all day? I want to say but, fearing the answer, I say nothing.

He finishes his toast and takes the tray out to the kitchen. When he comes back in he is wearing a coat.

‘I have to leave for work,’ he says. I feel myself become tense.

‘Don’t worry,’ he says. ‘You’ll be fine. I’ll call you. I promise. Remember, today is the same as every other day. You’ll be fine.’

‘But—’ I begin.

‘I have to go,’ he says. ‘I’m sorry. I’ll show you some things you might need, before I leave.’

In the kitchen he shows me what is in each cupboard, points out some leftover food in the fridge for my lunch and a whiteboard fixed to the wall, next to a black marker pen tied with string. ‘I sometimes leave messages here for you,’ he says. I see that he has written the word Friday on it in neat capital letters, and beneath it the words Laundry? Walk? (Take phone!) TV? Under the word Lunch, he has written that there is leftover salmon in the fridge and added the word Salad? Finally he has written that he will be home by six. ‘You also have a diary,’ he says. ‘In your bag. It has important phone numbers at the back, and our address, in case you get lost. And there’s a mobile phone—’

‘A what?’ I say.

‘A phone,’ he says. ‘It doesn't have a cord. You can use it anywhere. Outside the house, anywhere you like. It’ll be in your handbag. Make sure you take it with you if you go out.’

‘I will,’ I say.

‘Right,’ he says. We go into the hall and he picks up an old leather bag by the door. ‘I’ll be off, then.’

‘OK,’ I say. I am not sure what else to say. I feel like a child who is not at school, left alone at home while her parents go to work. Don’t touch anything, I imagine him saying. Don’t forget to take your medicine.

He comes over to where I stand. He kisses me, on the cheek. I don’t stop him, but neither do I kiss him back. He turns towards the front door, and is about to open it when he stops.

‘Oh!’ he says, looking back at me. ‘I almost forgot!’ His voice suddenly sounds unnatural, his excitement forced. He is trying too hard to sound natural; it is clear he has been planning to say this for a while.

In the end, it is not as bad as I feared. ‘We’re going away this evening,’ he says. ‘Just for the weekend. It’s our anniversary, so I thought I'd book something for us. Is that OK?’

I nod. ‘That sounds nice,’ I say.

He smiles, looks relieved. ‘Something to look forward to, eh? A bit of sea air? It’ll do us good.’ He turns back to the door and opens it. ‘I’ll call you later,’ he says. ‘See how you are doing.’

‘Yes,’ I say. ‘Yes, please.’

‘I love you, Christine,’ he says. ‘Never forget that.’

He closes the door behind him and I turn. I go back into the house.

Later, mid-morning. I sit in an armchair. The dishes are washed and neatly stacked to dry, the washing is in the machine. I have been keeping busy.

But now I feel empty inside. It’s true, what Ben said. I have no memory. Nothing. There is nothing in this house that I remember seeing before. Not a single photograph – either around the mirror or in the scrapbook in front of me – that triggers a recollection of when it was taken, not a moment with Ben that I can remember, other than since we met this morning. My mind feels totally empty.

I close my eyes, try to focus on something. Anything. Yesterday. Last Christmas. Any Christmas. My wedding. There is nothing.

I stand up. I move through the house, from room to room. Slowly. Moving slowly, like a ghost, letting my hand brush against the walls, tables, and furniture, but not really touching anything. How did I end up like this? I think. I look at the carpets, the patterned rugs, the small china figures on the mantelpiece and decorative plates arranged on the shelves in the dining room. I try to tell myself that this is mine. All mine. My home, my husband, my life. But these things do not belong to me. They are not part of me. In the bedroom I open the wardrobe door and see a row of clothes I don’t recognize, hanging neatly, like empty clothes of a woman I have never met. A woman whose home I am wandering through, whose soap and shampoo I have used, whose dressing gown I have taken off and whose slippers I am wearing. She is hidden from me, like a ghost, distant and untouchable. This morning I had chose my underwear feeling guilty, searching through the pairs of knickers, rolled up with tights and stockings, as if I was afraid someone would see me. I held my breath as I found silk and lace underwear at the back of the drawer, items bought to be seen as well as worn. Putting the unused ones back exactly as I found them, I chose a pale-blue pair that seemed to have a matching bra and put them both on, before pulling on a thick pair of tights, and then trousers and a blouse.

I had sat down at the dressing table to look at my face in the mirror, looking at my reflection carefully. I traced the lines on my forehead, the skin folds under my eyes. I smiled and looked at my teeth, and at the wrinkles that gathered around my mouth, the lines around my eyes that appeared. I noticed the spots on my skin, a discolored area on my forehead that looked like a bruise that hadn't quite gone away. I found some makeup and put a little on. Some light powder, a little blusher. I imagined a woman – my mother, I realize now – doing the same, calling it her warpaint, and this morning, as I pressed my lipstick on a tissue and put the cap back on the mascara, the word felt right. I felt that I was going into some kind of fight, or that some fight was coming to me.

Sending me to school. Putting on her make-up. I tried to think of my mother doing something else. Anything. Nothing appeared. I saw only an empty space, large gaps between small islands of memory, years of emptiness.

Now, in the kitchen, I open cupboards: bags of pasta, packets of rice called arborio, cans of kidney beans. I don’t recognize this food. I remember eating cheese on toast, fish in a boilable bag, corned beef sandwiches. I take out a can of chickpeas, a packet of something called couscous. I don’t know what these things are, let alone how to cook them. How then do I manage as a wife?

I look up at the whiteboard that Ben had shown me before he left. It is a dirty grey colour, words have been written on it and wiped off, replaced, changed, each leaving a faint mark. I wonder what I would find if I could go back and understand the layers, if it were possible to look into my past that way, but realize that, even if it were possible, it would be useless. I am certain that all I would find are messages and lists, food to buy, things to do.

Is that really my life? I think. Is that all I am? I take the pen and add another note to the board. Pack bag for tonight? it says. Not a big reminder, but it's mine.

I hear a noise. A tune, coming from my bag. I open it and empty its contents onto the sofa. My purse, some tissues, pens, a lipstick. A small makeup case, a receipt for two coffees. A diary, just a few inches square with a flower design on the front and a pencil in its spine.

I find something that I guess is the phone Ben described – it is small, plastic, with buttons that make it look like a toy. It is ringing, the screen is flashing. I press what I hope is the correct button.

‘Hello?’ I say. The voice that replies is not Ben’s.

‘Hi,’ it says. ‘Christine? Is that Christine Lucas?’

I don’t want to answer. My last name seems as strange as my first name did. I feel as though any solid ground I had found has disappeared again, replaced by quicksand.

‘Christine? Are you there?’

Who can it be? Who knows where I am, who I am? I realize it could be anyone. I feel panic rise in me. My finger is over the button that will end the call.

‘Christine? It’s me. Dr Nash. Please answer.’

The name means nothing to me, but still I say, ‘Who is this?’

The voice changes tone. Relief? ‘It’s Dr Nash,’ he says. ‘Your doctor?’

Another moment of panic. ‘My doctor?’ I say. I'm not ill, I want to add, but I don't even know this. I feel my mind start to spin.

‘Yes,’ he says. ‘But don’t worry. We’ve just been doing some work on your memory. Nothing’s wrong.’

I notice the words he used. 'Have been'. So this is someone else I have no memory of.

‘What kind of work?’ I say.

‘I’ve been trying to help you, to improve things,’ he says. ‘Trying to figure out exactly what caused your memory problems, and if there is anything we can do about them.’

It makes sense, though another thought comes to my mind. Why hadn't Ben mentioned this doctor before he left this morning?

‘How?’ I say. ‘What have we been doing?’

‘We’ve been meeting over the last few weeks. A couple of times a week, more or less.’

It doesn’t seem possible. Another person I see often who has left no memory in my mind at all.

But I’ve never met you before, I want to say. You could be anyone.

The same could be said about the man I woke up with this morning, and he turned out to be my husband.

‘I don’t remember,’ I say instead.

His voice becomes softer. ‘Don’t worry. I know.’ If what he says is true, then he must understand that better than anyone. He explains that our next appointment is today.

‘Today?’ I say. I think back to what Ben told me this morning, to the list of jobs on the board in the kitchen. ‘But my husband hasn’t mentioned anything to me.’ I realize it is the first time I have called the man I woke up with my husband.

There is a pause, and then Dr Nash says, ‘I’m not sure Ben knows you’re meeting me.’

I notice that he knows my husband’s name, but say, ‘That’s crazy! How can he not know? He would have told me!’

He sighs. ‘You’ll have to trust me,’ he says. ‘I can explain everything, when we meet. We are really making progress.’

When we meet. How can we do that? The thought of going out without Ben, without him even knowing where I am or who I am with, scares me a lot.

‘I’m sorry,’ I say. ‘I can’t.’

‘Christine,’ he says, ‘it’s important. If you look in your diary, you will see that what I am saying is true. Do you have it? It should be in your bag.’

I pick up the floral book from where it had fallen on to the sofa and feel the shock of seeing the year printed on the front in gold letters. Two thousand and seven. Twenty years later than it should be.

‘Yes.’

‘Look at today’s date,’ he says. ‘November thirtieth. You should see our appointment.’

I don’t understand how it can be November – December tomorrow – but still I quickly turn the pages, thin as tissue paper, to today's date. There, hidden between the pages, is a piece of paper, and on it, written in handwriting I don't recognize, are the words November 30th – seeing Dr Nash. Beneath them are the words Don’t tell Ben. I wonder if Ben has read them, if he looks through my things.

I decide there is no reason he would. The other days are empty. No birthdays, no evenings out, no parties. Does this really describe my life?

‘OK,’ I say. He explains that he will come and get me, that he knows where I live and will be there in an hour.

‘But my husband—’ I say.

‘It’s OK. We will be back long before he gets home from work. I promise. Trust me.’

The clock on the mantelpiece makes a sound, and I look at it quickly. It is old-fashioned, a large face in a wooden case, with roman numbers around the edge. It reads eleven thirty. Next to it is a silver key for winding it, something that I suppose Ben must remember to do every evening. Looks old enough to be an antique, and I wonder how we ended up owning such a clock. Perhaps it has no history, or no history with us at least, but is simply something we saw once, in a shop or at a market, and one of us liked it. Probably Ben, I think. I realize I don't like it.

I will see him just this once, I think. And then, tonight, when he gets home, I will tell Ben. I can't believe I am keeping something like this from him. Not when I depend so completely on him.

But there is a strange familiarity to Dr Nash’s voice. Unlike Ben, he does not seem completely strange to me. I realize I almost find it easier to believe that I have met him before than I believe I have met my husband.

We are making progress, he had said. I need to know what kind of progress he means.

‘OK,’ I say. ‘Come.’

When he arrives Dr Nash suggests we go for coffee. ‘Are you thirsty?’ he says. ‘I don’t think it’s worth driving all the way to the office. I mainly wanted to talk to you today, anyway.’

I nod, and say yes. I was in the bedroom when he arrived and watched him park his car and lock it, saw him fix his hair, smooth his jacket, pick up his briefcase. Not him, I thought as he nodded to the workmen unloading tools from a van, but then he walked up the path to our house. He looked young – too young to be a doctor – and, though I don't know what I had expected him to be wearing, it was not the sports jacket and grey corduroy trousers he was wearing.

‘There’s a park at the end of the street,’ he says. ‘I think it has a cafe. We could go there?’

We walk together. The cold is sharp and I pull my scarf tightly around my neck. I am glad I have in my bag the mobile phone that Ben has given me. Also glad that Dr Nash has not insisted we drive somewhere. There is a part of me that trusts this man, but another, bigger part tells me he could be anyone. A stranger.

I am an adult, but one who is not well. It would be easy for this man to take me somewhere, though I don’t know what he would want to do. I am as helpless as a child.

We reach the main road between the end of the street and the park opposite, and wait to cross. The silence between us feels heavy. I had planned to wait until we were sitting down before asking him, but I find myself speaking. ‘What sort of doctor are you?’ I am saying. ‘What do you do? How did you find me?’

He looks at me. ‘I’m a neuropsychologist,’ he says. He is smiling. I wonder if I ask him the same question every time we meet. ‘I specialize in patients with brain problems, with an interest in some of the newer brain scanning methods. For a long time, I have been especially interested in studying how memory works. I heard about you from books and articles on the subject, and found you. It was not too difficult.’

A car comes around the bend further up the road and heads towards us. ‘The literature?’

‘Yes. There have been a couple of studies written about you. I contacted the place where you were being treated before you came to live at home.’

‘Why? Why did you want to find me?’

He smiles. ‘Because I thought I could help you. I have been working with patients with these kinds of problems for a while. I believe they can be helped; however, they need more focused help than the usual one hour per week. I had some ideas about how real improvements could be made and wanted to try some of them. Plus, I have been writing a paper about your case. The most complete work, you could say.’ He starts to laugh, but stops quickly when I do not join in. He coughs. ‘Your case is unusual. I believe we can discover much more about how memory works than we already know.’

The car passes and we cross the road. I feel myself become anxious and tense. Brain problems. Studying. Found you. I try to breathe and relax, but I cannot. There are two of me now, in the same body: one is a forty-seven-year-old woman, calm, polite, knowing what is appropriate behaviour and what is not – and the other is in her twenties, and screaming. I cannot decide which is me, but the only noise I hear is distant traffic and the shouts of children from the park, so I guess it must be the first.

On the other side I stop and say, ‘Look, what is happening? I woke up this morning in a place I’ve never seen but that’s apparently my home, lying next to a man I have never met who tells me I have been married to him for years. And you seem to know more about me than I know about myself.’

He nods slowly. ‘You have amnesia,’ he says, putting his hand on my arm. ‘You have had amnesia for a long time. You cannot keep new memories, so you have forgotten much of what has happened to you during your entire adult life. Every day you wake up as if you are a young woman. Some days you wake up as if you are a child.’

Somehow it seems worse, coming from him. A doctor. ‘So it’s true?’

‘I am afraid so. Yes. The man at home is your husband. Ben. You’ve been married to him for years. Since long before your amnesia started.’ I nod. ‘Shall we go on?’

I say yes, and we walk into the park. A path goes around its edge, and there is a children’s playground nearby, next to a small building where I see people coming out carrying trays of snacks. We go there, and I sit at one of the Formica tables with chipped edges while Dr Nash orders our drinks.

When he returns he is carrying two plastic cups filled with strong coffee, mine black, his with milk. He adds sugar from the bowl on the table but does not offer any to me, and it is that, more than anything, that makes me sure we have met before. He looks up and asks me how I hurt my forehead.

‘What?’ I say at first, but then I remember the bruise I saw this morning. My makeup has clearly not covered it. ‘That?’ I say. ‘It is nothing, really. It doesn’t hurt.’

He doesn’t answer. He stirs his coffee.

‘So my husband takes care of me at home?’ I say.

He looks up. ‘Yes, though he has not always. At first, your condition was so bad that you needed care all the time. It has only been quite recently that Ben felt he could take care of you alone.’

So the way I feel now is an improvement, then. I am glad I cannot remember the time when things were worse.

‘He must love me very much,’ I say, more to myself than to Nash.

He nods. There is a pause. We both drink our coffee. ‘Yes. I think he must.’

I smile, and look down at my hands holding the hot drink, at the gold wedding ring, at my short nails, at my legs, crossed politely. I do not recognize my own body.

‘Why does not my husband know that I am seeing you?’ I say.

He sighs and closes his eyes. ‘I will be honest,’ he says, holding his hands together and leaning forward in his seat. ‘At first, I asked you not to tell Ben that you were seeing me.’

A sudden feeling of fear goes through me, almost like an echo. Yet he does not look like someone you cannot trust.

‘Go on,’ I say. I want to believe he can help me.

‘Several people – doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists and others – have contacted you and Ben in the past, wanting to work with you. But he has always been very unwilling to let you see these professionals. He has made it very clear that you have had a lot of treatment before, and in his opinion, it has only upset you. Naturally, he wanted to protect you – and himself – from any more upset.’

Of course; he does not want to make me hope too much. ‘So you convinced me to come and see you without him knowing?’

‘Yes. I did contact Ben first. We spoke on the phone. I even asked him to meet with me so that I could explain what I could offer, but he refused. So I contacted you directly.’

Another sudden feeling of fear, as if from nowhere. ‘How?’ I say.

He looked down at his drink. ‘I went to see you. I waited until you came out of the house and then introduced myself.’

‘And I agreed to see you? Just like that?’

‘Not at first. No. I had to convince you that you could trust me. I suggested that we should meet once, just for one session. Without Ben's knowledge if that was necessary. I said I would explain to you why I wanted you to come and see me, and what I thought I could offer you.’

‘And I agreed...’

He looks up. ‘Yes,’ he says. ‘I told you that after that first visit, it was completely up to you whether you chose to tell Ben or not, but if you decided not to, I would call you to make sure you remembered our appointments, and so on.’

‘And I chose not to.’

‘That is right. You have spoken about wanting to wait until we were making progress before telling him. You felt that was better.’

‘And are we?’

‘What?’

‘Making progress?’

He drinks some more coffee, then puts his cup back on the table. ‘I believe so, yes. Though progress is somewhat difficult to measure exactly. But many memories seem to have come back to you over the last few weeks – many of them for the first time, as far as we know. And there are certain truths that you are aware of more often, when there were few before. For example, you sometimes wake up and remember that you are married now. And …’ He pauses.

‘And?’ I say.

‘And, well, you are becoming more independent, I think.’

‘Independence?’

‘Yes. You do not rely on Ben as much as you did. Or me.’

That is it, I think. That is the progress he is talking about. Independence. Perhaps he means I can go to the shops or a library without someone with me, though right now I am not even sure that is true. In any case, I have not yet made enough progress for me to show it proudly to my husband. Not even enough for me to always wake up remembering I have a husband.

‘But that is all?’

‘It is important,’ he says. ‘Do not underestimate it, Christine.’

I don’t say anything. I take a sip of my coffee and look around the cafe. It is almost empty. There are voices from a small kitchen at the back, the occasional rattling sound as the water in a large pot boils, the noise of children playing in the distance. It is difficult to believe that this place is so close to my home, and yet I have no memory of ever being here before.

‘You say we have been meeting for a few weeks,’ I say to Dr Nash. ‘So what have we been doing?’

‘Do you remember anything from our previous sessions? Anything at all?’

‘No,’ I say. ‘Nothing. As far as I know, I am meeting you for the first time today.’

‘Forgive me for asking,’ he says. ‘As I said, you have flashes of memory sometimes. It seems you know more on some days than on others.’

‘I do not understand,’ I say. ‘I have no memory of ever meeting you before, or of what happened yesterday, or the day before, or last year. Yet I can remember some things from years ago. My childhood. My mother. I remember being at university, just barely. I do not understand how these old memories could have survived when everything else has been wiped clean.’

He nods while I ask my question. I do not doubt he has heard it before. Possibly I ask the same thing every week. Possibly we have exactly the same conversation.

‘Memory is a complex thing,’ he says. ‘People have a short-term memory that can store facts and information for about a minute, but also a long-term memory. Here we can store large amounts of information, and keep it for a seemingly endless amount of time. We now know that these two functions seem to be controlled by different parts of the brain, with some nerve connections between them. There is also a part of the brain which seems to be responsible for taking short-term, temporary memories and saving them as long-term memories to be remembered much later.’

He speaks easily and quickly, as if he is now on familiar ground. I would have been like that once, I suppose; confident.

‘There are two main types of amnesia,’ he says. ‘Most commonly, the affected person cannot remember past events, with more recent events being most affected. So if, for example, the person has a car accident, they may not remember the accident, or the days or weeks before it, but can remember everything up to, say, six months before the accident perfectly well.’

I nod. ‘And the other?’

‘The other is more rare,’ he says. ‘Sometimes there is an inability to move memories from short-term storage into long-term storage. People with this condition live in the moment, able to remember only the immediate past, and then only for a short time.’

He stops talking, as if waiting for me to say something. It is as if we each have our lines, have practiced this conversation often.

‘I have both?’ I say. ‘A loss of the memories I had, plus an inability to create new ones?’

He coughs. ‘Yes, unfortunately. It is not common, but perfectly possible. What is unusual in your case, however, is the pattern of your amnesia. Generally, you have no consistent memory of anything that happened since your early childhood, but you seem to process new memories in a way I have never seen before. If I left this room now and came back in two minutes, most people with anterograde amnesia would not remember having met me at all, certainly not today. But you seem to remember whole periods of time – up to twenty-four hours – which you then lose. That is not typical. To be honest, it does not make any sense, considering how we believe memory works. It suggests you are able to move things from short-term to long-term storage perfectly well. I do not understand why you cannot keep them.’

I may be living a broken life, but at least it is broken into pieces large enough for me to seem somewhat independent. I guess that means I am lucky.

‘Why?’ I say. ‘What has caused it?’

He does not say anything. The room becomes quiet. The air feels still and heavy. When he speaks, his words seem to echo off the walls. ‘Many things can cause memory problems,’ he says. ‘Either long-term or short-term. Illness, injury, drug use. The exact nature of the problem seems to be different, depending on the part of the brain that has been affected.’

‘Yes,’ I say. ‘But what has caused mine?’

He looks at me for a moment. ‘What has Ben told you?’

I think back to our conversation in the bedroom. An accident, he had said. A bad accident.

‘He did not really tell me anything,’ I say. ‘Nothing specific, anyway. He just said I had had an accident.’

‘Yes,’ he says, reaching for his bag under the table. ‘Your amnesia was caused by injury. That is true, at least partly.’ He opens his bag and takes out a book. At first, I wonder if he is going to look at his notes, but instead, he passes it across the table to me. ‘Look. I want you to have this,’ he says. ‘It will explain everything. Better than I can. Especially about what has caused your condition. But other things as well.’

I take it from him. It is brown, covered in leather, its pages held closed by an elastic band. I take that off and open it randomly. The paper is heavy and has faint lines, with a red line down the side, and the pages are filled with a lot of handwriting. ‘What is it?’ I say.

‘It is a journal,’ he says. ‘One that you have been keeping over the past few weeks.’

I am shocked. ‘A journal?’ I wonder why he has it.

‘Yes. A record of what we have been doing recently. I asked you to keep it. We have been doing a lot of work trying to find out exactly how your memory works. I thought it might be helpful for you to keep a record of what we have been doing.’

‘So I have written this?’

‘Yes. I told you to write whatever you like in it. Many people with amnesia have tried similar things, but usually it is not as helpful as you might think because they have such a small window of memory. But as there are some things that you can remember for the whole day, I did not see why you should not write down some notes in a book every evening. I thought it might help you to keep a connection of memory from one day to the next. Also, I felt that memory might be like a muscle, something that can be made stronger through practice.’

‘And you have been reading it, as we have been going along?’

‘No,’ he says. ‘You have been writing it in private.’

‘But how?’ I begin, and then say, ‘Has Ben been reminding me to write in it?’

He shakes his head. ‘I suggested that you keep it secret,’ he says. ‘You have been hiding it at home. I have been calling you to tell you where it is hidden.’

‘Every day?’

‘Yes. More or less.’

‘Not Ben?’

He pauses, then says, ‘No. Ben has not read it.’

I wonder why not, what it might contain that I do not want my husband to see. What secrets might I have? Secrets I do not even know myself.

‘But you have read it?’

‘You left it with me a few days ago,’ he says. ‘You said you wanted me to read it. That it was time.’

I look at the book. I am excited. A journal. A link back to a lost past, even if only recent.

‘Have you read it all?’

‘Yes,’ he says. ‘Most of it. I think I have read everything important, anyway.’ He pauses and looks away from me, scratching the back of his neck. Embarrassed, I think. I wonder if he is telling me the truth about what the book contains. He finishes the last of his mug of coffee, and says, ‘I did not force you to let me see it. I want you to know that.’

I nod and finish the rest of my coffee in silence, quickly turning the pages of the book as I do so. On the inside of the front cover is a list of dates. ‘What are these?’ I say.

‘They are the dates we have been meeting,’ he says. ‘As well as the ones we had planned. We have been arranging them as we go along. I have been calling to remind you, asking you to look in your journal.’

I think of the yellow note hidden between the pages of my diary today. ‘But today?’

‘Today I had your journal,’ he says. ‘So we wrote a note instead.’

I nod, and look through the rest of the book. It is filled with a lot of handwriting that I do not recognize. Page after page. Days and days of work.

I wonder how I found the time, but then think of the board in the kitchen, and the answer is obvious; I have had nothing else to do.

I put it back on the table. A young man wearing jeans and a T-shirt comes in and looks over to where we are sitting, before ordering a drink and sitting at a table with the newspaper. He does not look up at me again, and the twenty-year-old me is upset. I feel as though I am invisible.

‘Shall we go?’ I say.

We walk back the way we came. The sky has clouded over, and a thin mist is in the air. The ground feels wet under my feet; it feels like walking on quicksand. On the playground, I see a roundabout, turning slowly even though no one is riding it.

‘We do not normally meet here?’ I say, when we reach the road. ‘In the cafe, I mean?’

‘No. No, we normally meet in my office. We do exercises. Tests and things.’

‘So why here today?’

‘I really just wanted to give you your book back,’ he says. ‘I was worried about you not having it.’

‘I have come to rely on it?’ I say.

‘In a way, yes.’

We walk back down to the house I share with Ben. I can see Dr Nash's car, still parked where he left it, the small garden outside our window, the short path and neat flower beds. I still cannot quite believe this is the place where I live.

‘Do you want to come in?’ I say. ‘Another drink?’

He shakes his head. ‘No. No, I will not, thanks. I have to go. Julie and I have plans this evening.’

He stands for a moment, looking at me. I notice his hair, cut short, neatly parted, and the way his shirt has vertical stripes that do not match the horizontal ones on his sweater. I realize that he is only a few years older than I thought I was when I woke up this morning. ‘Julie is your wife?’

He smiles and shakes his head. ‘No, my girlfriend. Actually, my fiancée. We got engaged. I keep forgetting.’

I smile back at him. These are the details I should remember, I suppose. The little things. Perhaps it is these small things I have been writing down in my book, these small things on which a whole life is built.

‘Congratulations,’ I say, and he thanks me.

I feel like I should ask more questions, should show more interest, but there is little point. Anything he tells me now, I will have forgotten by the time I wake up tomorrow. Today is all I have. ‘I should get back anyway,’ I say. ‘We are going away this weekend. To the coast. I need to pack later...’

He smiles. ‘Goodbye, Christine,’ he says. He turns to leave, but then looks back at me. ‘Your journal has my numbers written in it,’ he says. ‘At the front. Call me if you would like to see me again. To continue with your treatment, I mean. OK?’

‘If?’ I say. I remember my journal, the appointments that we had written in between now and the end of the year. ‘I thought we had more sessions planned?’

‘You will understand when you read your book,’ he says. ‘It will all make sense. I promise.’

‘OK,’ I say. I realize I trust him, and I am glad. Glad that I do not only have my husband to rely on.

‘It is up to you, Christine. Call me, whenever you like.’

‘I will,’ I say, and then he waves and gets into his car and, checking over his shoulder, he drives out into the road and is gone.

I make a cup of coffee and carry it into the living room. From outside, I hear whistling, mixed with heavy drilling and occasional short bursts of laughter, but even that fades to a gentle buzz as I sit in the armchair. The sun shines weakly through the thin curtains, and I feel its gentle warmth on my arms and thighs. I take the journal out of my bag.

I feel nervous. I do not know what this book will contain. What shocks and surprises. What mysteries. I see the scrapbook on the coffee table. In that book is a version of my past, but one chosen by Ben. Does the book I hold contain another? I open it.

The first page has no lines. I have written my name in black ink across the middle. Christine Lucas. It is a wonder I have not written Private! below it. Or Keep out!

Something has been added. Something unexpected, terrifying. More terrifying than anything else I have seen today. There, below my name, in blue ink and capital letters, are three words.

DON'T TRUST BEN.

There is nothing I can do but turn the page.

I begin to read my history.
