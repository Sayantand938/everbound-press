## Chapter 10

Heather had the hemp rope around Danny’s neck and she just kept tightening it until Danny collapsed to his knees, dropping the knife.

“Stop this, Ivan!” Ma said.

Ivan grabbed Heather by the hair and tossed her into the dirt like she was nothing.

“I’ll have her,” Danny snarled, recovering himself.

“You’ve done enough mischief tonight, mate,” Jacko said, putting a boot on Danny’s back and flattening him. Matt took the rifle off his shoulder and pointed it at Danny. “That’s enough, Dan!” he yelled.

Danny laughed bitterly. “Oh, it’s come to this, has it? Who are you, anyway? You don’t give orders to anybody here. Least of all me.”

“I’m as much an O’Neill as anyone. And I am not going to have you tell me any different,” Matt said.

Heather wasn’t interested in any of this now. She crawled toward Tom.

He was lying on his side in a pool of blood.

“We have to call an ambulance!” she wailed hysterically.

“We’ve no phones here,” Kate said.

“You have to help him!” Heather yelled.

“That’s enough,” Ma said.

“No! We can still save him,” Heather said. “Please! We can help him!”

Heather grabbed Danny’s fallen knife in her tied hands and struggled to her feet. There were half a dozen guns pointed at her now.

“You have to help,” Heather pleaded, brandishing the knife.

“You should drop it, sweetheart,” Kate said.

Ivan smacked Heather on the side of the head and snatched the knife out of her hands as she fell.

And then Kate fired a barrel of her shotgun into the air and everyone froze.

“Thank you, my dear,” Ma said. “This is a bloody shambles, this is! Takes me to sort it as usual, eh? Never a moment’s peace. First things first—get the bodies up to the house. Take ’em to the old meat locker.”

“Krauts are up in the house. What about them?” Ivan said.

“Jesus wept! Don’t let them see anything. And don’t let them go. Keep them here until we figure out what we’re going to bloody do,” Ma said.

“We know what we’re going to do,” Jacko said. “We’re not letting the cops have Danny.”

With difficulty, Ma got out of her rocking chair. “Does anybody listen to me around here anymore?”

“Yes, Ma,” half a dozen men said.

“Get these bodies up to the house!”

Two men picked up Tom, one taking his ankles and the other his shoulders, and carried him away. Heather was sobbing now. Tom was dead. Tom, who was so calm and centered. Tom, who knew everything. What the hell was she going to do?

Another two men took Ellen up to the house. Killer and victim united. What were their ghosts talking about?

Tom, oh my God, Tom.

Heather squeezed her eyes tight.

Tried to erase the last few hours.

That lifeless face. That lifeless crow’s-wing fringe.

This can’t be happening.

I’m in Melbourne. Tom’s gonna wake me up and we’re going to go see penguins and koalas.

She attempted to open her eyes but had to wipe blood from her eyelids first.

Mosquitoes.

Upside-down moon.

Crowd of people with guns.

Black blood in the dead-Tom dirt under the dead-Tom stars.

A little kid pointing a toy gun at her.

Real men with real guns.

She sat up.

People talking in low voices.

Heather knew she wasn’t going to get many more chances to make them see reason.

“You have to let us go now. This has gone too far,” she said.

“Shut this bitch up, Matthew. If she talks again without my permission, break her jaw,” Ma said.

“You hear that?” Matt said to Heather.

She nodded.

“So what are we going to do?” Ivan asked.

“Get rid of them, sharpish!” someone said.

“Hold on,” Danny said, wiping the dust off his clothes. “You have to ask me what to do. They belong to me. All of them.”

“You stupid bastard,” Kate said. “You cost us five hundred grand. You always were a dumb arsehole. Thick as shit, you. Thick as shit.”

“Cut him some slack, Katie. Ellen’s dead,” Matt said.

“She is. She was all I had. You know that. No amount of money…” Danny’s voice trailed away.

People came over to pat Danny on the back and touch him and hug him. Some took the opportunity to spit at, pinch, or poke Heather.

She could feel herself sinking. She was so thirsty. Everything ached. She was sitting cross-legged on the ground. A blood trail was making its way toward her through the dust. She tried to breathe. Breathing hurt. Her ribs hurt. The air was thick. Her grandmother said the dead could see us through mirrors. Maybe Tom could see her somehow. What would he advise her to do?

“If I have to be out here, can someone do something about the bloody mozzies?” Ma said.

Someone lit a fire in a brazier. Cans of beer started getting passed around.

“The question remains: What do we do with the three of them?” Matt said.

“Top ’em. No choice,” Jacko said.

“No,” Matt said. “That will stir things up.”

“Who’s going to miss them? They’re not even Aussies, none of them,” Ivan said.

“Let’s find out who’s going to miss ’em, Kate,” Ma said.

Kate grabbed Heather by the hair and pulled her to her feet.

“Where are you from?” she asked Heather.

“What?”

Kate slapped Heather across the face. “Where are you from, bitch?”

“Seattle, Washington.”

“And what exactly were you doing down here?” Kate asked.

“Tom’s here for a conference and we came along for some sightseeing. We went to Sydney and Uluru and Melbourne, and the kids wanted to see some koalas in the countryside…”

Kate dropped her and she fell back into the dirt.

“Yank tourists, Ma, that’s about the size of it,” Kate said.

“Tourists. So who will miss them, do you think?” Ma wondered out loud.

“Somebody will,” Matt said.

“Yes! Tom’s the keynote speaker,” Heather said. “At the, um, at the International Conference of Orthopedic Medicine. You can’t just disappear us. The car-rental company knows too. We had to sign forms. The best thing to do is let us go and—”

“That’s enough!” Ma said.

“No, wait, listen to me, things don’t have to—” Heather began but Kate leaned down and with one big white paw squeezed Heather’s cheeks hard.

“The only witnesses are the Krauts, is that right?” Ma asked.

“Our Ned was running the food stand. No one saw them follow us to the ferry except for the Krauts,” Jacko said.

Ma lit a cigarette and waved for people to clear a space around her chair. The murmuring gradually ended and the crowd grew quiet. Heather’s head had stopped pounding and in the silence she could hear birds roosting in the distant eucalyptus trees. A jet was high above her, its vapor trail just visible in the moonlight. Everything was moving into the future. She was too. Tom, poor Tom, would be dead forever. She had to consider herself and the kids now.

“Please. I know what you’re thinking and it’s not going to work,” Heather pleaded.

“You forced us into this. You killed Ellen and tried to cover it up. This is on you,” Ma said.

“Don’t make things worse. You—”

“Matt! I told you to shut that bitch up,” Ma said coldly and calmly. “This is your final warning, girl. If you speak again without my permission, I’m going to have Lenny, our blacksmith, cut your tongue out with his leather-cutting scissors. Nod your bloody head if you understand. Not one bloody word from you. Do you understand?”

Heather nodded.

“Just the Krauts, eh? Matt, what if we dumped the car somewhere on the mainland?”

Matt nodded. “The car’s GPS will have stopped well before Stamford Bridge.”

“Jamie, could you smash the car up bad?” Ma asked someone whom Heather couldn’t see.

“Oh, yeah. Easy. Lotta drop-offs on the Red Hill Road. Some as deep as twenty-five meters. Car goes over one of those, little tampering with the fuel lines…boom.”

“What do you think, Ivan?”

He thought for a long time before finally clearing his throat. “I like the plan, Ma. Cops will find the car in a few days and just think, Ah, too bad, dumb Americans forgot which side of the road to drive on,” Ivan said.

“The Melbourne cops are smart, though—what if they come over here?” Kate asked.

“We don’t know nothing about any Americans; we keep ourselves to ourselves.”

“Oi, look, this is my decision, innit? Mine,” Danny said. “Under the old laws. They done me wrong, not any of you.”

“You cost us half a million bucks, Danny! You can shut your mouth!” Ivan said.

“What is it you want, Daniel?” Ma asked.

Danny strode into the center of the circle. Someone had passed him an earthen drinking jug and he took an enormous sip of liquor that was so strong, Heather could smell it from where she was sprawled on the ground.

“What do I want?” Danny said after a pause.

“There’s nothing they can give you now, mate,” Matt said.

“Yeah, no, look…I lost a wife and I heard there’s a girl. I want to see the girl. Bring her to me,” Danny said, wiping his mouth.

“Ivan?” Ma asked.

“Maybe not a good idea, Ma. If we’re going to go down this route, there can’t be any survivors,” Jacko said.

“I want my rights,” Danny insisted.

“You lost a wife, not a kid,” Matt said.

“I can’t take this violent bloody bitch. We can’t trust her,” Danny said, pointing at Heather.

Kate laughed. “You’re right. She’d cut all our throats, this one.”

“It’s my right, innit?” Danny said.

“What would the cops think, Ivan, if there were only three bodies?” Ma asked.

“I suppose the girl might have survived the crash, gone wandering for help, got lost, and her body was never found,” Ivan said.

“It might even help us,” Jacko said. “The cops will be focused on finding the missing girl over on the mainland. We won’t be part of the story.”

“Kill them all!” someone yelled.

Ma put her hands up for silence. “I’ve listened and I am going to sleep on my decision,” she said. “We don’t need to do anything tonight, do we, Matt?”

“No. And we don’t want to be running the ferry at night anyway. Nothing unusual,” Matt said.

“Tomorrow, if I decide that way, we can take the car over to the mainland and have Jamie crash it up the Red Hill Road. The rest of us can get to bed now. My legs hurt. I forgot me good ciggies,” Ma continued.

“What about me?” Danny said.

“Bugger you, Danny!” Jacko snarled.

“All right, we’ll let Danny take a look at the girl. Someone go get her!” Ma said.

“So the plan is we kill this one and the boy?” Kate asked, gesturing toward Heather.

Heather shook her head no. This was unreal. They couldn’t mean that. This was all some kind of mistake. A nightmare. A—

“Maybe,” Ma said. “Where’s those ciggies?”

A little girl handed Ma a pack of cigarettes. She lit one up and passed the box around.

“Where are the Krauts now?”

“They’re still up at the house,” Jacko said. “I told them we were getting the ferry repaired and they bought it, but then the geezer said something stupid.”

“What did he say?” Matt groaned.

“He noticed the snorkel on the Porsche was bent and asked if someone had had an accident.”

“Shite!” Ma said. “You’ve really screwed things up for us, haven’t you, Daniel?”

“Ellen’s dead. I want me rights.”

“You’re getting your rights, Danny,” Kate said. “But, mate, because of you we’re going to have to kill two more people to be on the safe side.”

Heather got to her feet. “You cannot be serious about this! Have you all lost your minds?” she cried.

“I warned you! I bloody warned you. Didn’t I warn her? Take out her tongue, Lenny,” Ma said.

A large, tanned, lean bald man began moving through the crowd. He was wearing a leather apron and a singlet coated with filth. His eyes were black; his expression was dull. He reeked of dried blood and offal.

He grabbed Heather violently by the head and locked his arm around her neck.

She punched and scraped at his arm as he shoved two enormous fingers into her mouth. She bit the fingers, but it was like biting into blocks of wood.

“Yeah, I can do this. Jodie, go get me scissors, I’ll take care of her,” he said. Heather tried to scream but she couldn’t breathe or make a sound.
