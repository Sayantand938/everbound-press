## Chapter 3

Tom woke just before the dawn. The inevitable adrenaline dump after a busy day meeting people had sent him straight to sleep. Heather was snoring softly as he slipped carefully out of the bed. He watched her for a moment or two and smiled broadly. She was the best. She was so funny, mellow, and sweet. The kids weren’t quite sold on her yet, but they’d get there. Judith wouldn’t have come to Australia in a million years, but for Heather, everything was an adventure.

He went to the roof, sat by the pool, and meditated for ten minutes, breathing deep and surfing the now. Then he did fifty push-ups followed by fifty sit-ups. This was a routine he’d been doing since his early days in medical school as a way of calming his mind and keeping himself focused. He could never have coped this past year without his morning rituals.

Next, Tom went downstairs, got a drink of water, and called the car-rental place. He was annoyed to discover that the Porsche Cayenne he had reserved was no longer available. He would have to take either the E-Hybrid or an older Turbo.

“I wanted the new Cayenne. I called about it last night,” he said, trying to control his temper.

“I’m sorry, sir, we don’t have any in the lot. The customer before you got the last one. We have the Turbo or the E-Hybrid. The hybrid is our top Porsche rental, it’s—”

“No, thank you. It’s a long drive. There is no way I would ever trust a hybrid!”

“We do have a BMW SUV for—”

“I’ll take the Turbo. Can you get it over here by nine o’clock? I’d like to make an early start. We’re at three Wordsworth Street in St. Kilda.”

“Of course, sir.”

Tom hung up, steaming. No one ever did their job. No one.

He changed into shorts and a T-shirt, pulled on his sneakers, and went for a run along the shore. Then it was upstairs to the swimming pool. He dove into the water and did a lap or two before coming back inside. He showered, and because the mirror was steamed, he shaved with the electric razor using his phone camera. He’d lost weight on this trip and it suited him. He looked like a young Ted Hughes.

“You did it, buddy. You survived the past year. I’m proud of you, partner,” he said to Phone-Camera Tom. “A paper in the Journal of Orthopedic Surgery. International conferences. Keynote addresses. Success at forty-four. Who would have thought it? If Judith could see you now, she’d be happy for you.”

Phone-Camera Tom thought about that for a second and slowly shook his head.

He wrapped himself in a towel and went into the bedroom. Heather appeared from a closet door he hadn’t noticed before. She was wearing a robe and listening to that “212” song she loved and he hated.

“Where have you been?” Tom asked.

“Narnia,” she said.

Tom grinned. “Do anything interesting?”

“Queen stuff…and, you know, I could slip out of my royal garb pretty quick,” she whispered.

“The kids?”

“Are sound asleep.”

She stripped and he stripped and they fell onto the bed. They made love for the first time since they’d left America, climaxing together as sunlight streamed through the shutters. Heather rested on Tom’s chest.

She kissed him on the chin. “You missed a spot when you were shaving.”

“I’ll fix it.”

“I like it. It gives you a hipster, Zappa-esque quality.”

Tom shook his head. “People like their doctors to look boring. Boring and calm and competent.”

“You’re two of those things,” Heather said, kissing him again.

Tom closed his eyes. “This has been a hard year for all of us. And I’ve been trying, haven’t I?”

“You have,” Heather said. “We all have.”

“I really love you, babe,” Tom said, kissing her back.

“I love you too…uh-oh. Everything OK?” she asked. “Now you’ve got a worry wrinkle in your forehead.”

“I didn’t get the car I wanted. I wanted the new Cayenne with the advanced GPS and the rear camera and the accident-avoidance system, but they only had the—”

The door opened and a sleepy Olivia came in.

“When are we leaving?” she asked as Heather covered herself.

“As soon as Owen gets up. And, look, if we really have to do this trip, we need to leave early and get back early. I’ve got to work on my speech. The conference is going to put it on YouTube,” Tom said.

Olivia ran into the hallway. “Get up, Owen! You’re late!” she screamed.

Owen growled a response and a fight began. Tom slithered out of bed, ran to the bedroom door, and closed it. The fighting was instantly muffled.

“I thought you were going to put a stop to that,” Heather said.

“Parenting 101, honey: what you can’t see or hear isn’t happening,” Tom said.

Despite the fighting, an hour later they were in a bright orange Porsche Cayenne heading southeast out of Melbourne on the highway. The road was big and new, carving mercilessly through Melbourne’s drab eastern suburbs. The Porsche was as comfortable as you would expect, although it was an odd-looking thing with a large front “snorkel” for driving through flooded rivers.

No flooded rivers today. They were ten thousand miles away from America, but this, Tom reflected, could have been suburbs anywhere. Targets, Walmarts, strip malls. Interesting, though. This, he imagined, was the “real Australia,” off the tourist trail, where people actually lived.

They drove down through the Mornington Peninsula, the suburbs gradually thinning out and a hilly country emerging. Heather pointed out kookaburras and big black ravens on the sagging telegraph wires. She took a picture of a lorikeet and sent it to Carolyn.

The kids, however, were not interested in birds and were getting increasingly frustrated. “Where are the kangaroos? Where are the frickin’ koalas?” Owen demanded.

Tom looked at him in the rearview mirror and frowned. That kid was so unlike his sister. If Tom had gotten a trip to Australia when he was Owen’s age, he would have appreciated every second of it. Now Owen would be huffy until they got back and he took his diazepam. Tom was about to give Owen a piece of his mind when Heather put her hand on his thigh. “Kids, here’s one your dad told me yesterday,” she said. “Koalas aren’t technically bears—do you know why?”

“Please, Dad, don’t let her say it! Yours are bad enough!” Olivia begged.

“Because they don’t have the right koalifications,” Heather said as both kids face-palmed.

The road got rougher and went to a single lane as they approached the coast. Wireless and Siri and Google Maps ceased working.

It was another hot day out there—106 degrees—but inside the car, everyone had a water bottle from the Airbnb and it was a cool 68.

It was noon now and they hadn’t seen much of anything and Tom wanted to get back to Melbourne to work on his keynote speech on knee-replacement surgery. The kids were hungry, so they stopped at a little food stand. Smoke from a barbecue was fighting a rearguard action against a persistent swarm of mosquitoes. A scraggly-looking geezer in his fifties was selling beer and soft drinks and “sausage sizzles,” which appeared to be sausages between pieces of Wonder bread.

Heather, Olivia, and Owen each got a sausage sizzle at a pricey five bucks a pop. Tom demurred and got a can of beer instead. They sat down at a picnic table in the shade.

With no phone signal, Tom grabbed his massive book of Chekhov stories and plays. Owen took out his astronomy worksheet from the back pages of his snake book. He stared at it angrily for a minute or two. “This is impossible,” he muttered at last.

“I can help you with that,” Olivia said.

“I don’t need your help!” Owen snapped.

An ancient-looking Volkswagen camper van pulled up and a thin couple in their late fifties or early sixties exited. They got two cans of Victoria Bitter and sat down at the free table under the shade. The couples couldn’t help but say hello.

“I’m Tom and this is my wife, Heather, and these are my kids, Owen and Olivia,” Tom said.

“I’m Hans and this is Petra,” Hans replied.

“We’re Americans. From Seattle,” Tom said.

“We are from Leiden in Holland,” Hans said. “I’m an engineer. From a very long line of engineers. Auto engineers.”

“Oh, yes?”

“Yes indeed. My great-grandfather invented the steering wheel.”

Owen raised his head from his homework. “Your actual grandfather, like, invented the steering wheel?” he asked incredulously.

“My great-grandfather.”

“He told you that?” Owen asked.

“Yes.”

“I doubt it,” Owen said, shaking his head.

“So what do you do, Petra?” Heather asked the woman.

“I am a sociologist,” she replied.

Owen was still regarding Hans with deep twelve-year-old-boy skepticism. It was starting to get a little uncomfortable. “I think it is too hot here. We will eat in the car,” Hans announced. The couple went back to the Volkswagen van.

“Owen, why did you give that guy a hard time?” Tom asked when they’d gone.

“I didn’t give him a hard time. I totally believed him. After all, my great-great-grandmother invented the spoon. Before that, only forks,” Owen said.

“And our great-great-great-grandfather invented fire,” Olivia said.

Heather, Owen, and Olivia were all laughing now and Tom started laughing too.

A Toyota Hilux pulled in and two men got out. The bigger of the two was wearing a sort of cowboy hat, jeans, a red-checkered shirt, and boots. He was about thirty-five, with a neatly trimmed black beard, dark eyebrows, and blue eyes. Handsome, Tom supposed, if you liked the rugged, outdoorsy type. The second man was slightly shorter, maybe around six feet. He was older, about fifty, balding. He was lean and rangy and looked a bit menacing. His left cheek was scarred and there was an old tattoo on his neck that could possibly have been an anchor. He was wearing overalls with rubber boots and no undershirt.

Tom looked at his watch. It was noon. “Well, folks, time to head back,” he said.

“We haven’t seen a koala!” Olivia protested.

“We haven’t seen anything!” Owen added.

“We gave it our best shot. But I have to get home to work,” Tom said.

Owen went into a complete meltdown: He was the worst dad ever. This trip sucked. Why had they even bothered coming to Australia if they weren’t going to see anything? Olivia crossed her arms, shook her head, and glowered with all her might.

Tom looked at Heather but she was helpless in the face of this.

“Excuse me, mates,” a voice said. It was the taller of the two men. “Couldn’t help overhearing—you kids wanna see a koala?”

“Yes!” Olivia said.

“Follow me,” the man said.

The family followed him to the back of the Toyota, where, in a cage under a blanket, there was a sleeping koala.

“Oooh! Can we hold him?” Olivia asked.

“Nah, sorry, can’t do that,” the man said. “They’re very vulnerable to disease, and you’re Americans, I take it.”

“Yes, from Seattle,” Tom said. “I’m Tom and this is Heather, Olivia, and Owen.”

“I’m Matt, and this experiment gone wrong is me brother Jacko,” Matt said.

“Hey! Watch your mouth!” Jacko snarled.

“Where did this little guy come from?” Heather asked, gesturing to the koala.

“We’re from across the bay there—private island—and there’s koalas bloody everywhere. And wallabies, echidnas, wombats—it’s like Jurassic bloody Park, mate,” Jacko said.

The kids turned to their dad. “We have to go!” Olivia said.

Tom shook his head. “Did you say private island?”

“Yeah, sorry, no visitors,” Matt said.

“Dad!” Owen protested and Olivia chimed in with a theatrical sigh of disbelief.

Tom looked at them. They had had a very tough year. And he’d been so strict on this trip. Maybe a little ugly-American grease would do the trick? “Is there a ferry? We’d be willing to pay,” Tom said.

Matt shook his head. “There is a ferry but it’s not about the money. Ma doesn’t like visitors. Dutch Island is her place, you know?”

“How much money?” Jacko said.

Tom had taken out three hundred bucks at the Alice Springs airport and he’d received his conference per diem of seven hundred dollars. He had close to a thousand Aussie dollars on him. He opened his wallet. “Four…five hundred bucks? Just to see, maybe take some photos? For the kids,” he said.

“You Yanks! You can’t bloody buy everything, mate!” Matt said, shaking his head with disgust. But Jacko put his arm around Matt and led him away for a minute. The two men got into a furious discussion. The Dutch couple had come out of their van to see what was happening.

“Dutch Island, did he say?” Hans asked.

“If you can do nine hundred bucks, that will be three hundred each for me, Matt, and Ivan, who runs the ferry,” Jacko said. “But you’d have to be bloody fast. Just some quick photos and then off again.”

“Nine hundred bucks! That’s crazy,” Tom protested. That was—what? Five hundred American?

“Dad!” Owen wailed again.

“Maybe we should just go back to Melbourne,” Heather said.

“You’ll be missing out. It’s a very special place,” Jacko said. “Unique. Animals everywhere. We make our own electricity. Grow our own food. No phones. No taxes. No law enforcement. When was the last time we had a copper out here, Matty?”

“Before my time,” Matt said. “But that’s not the—”

“Koalas, birds, even some penguins,” Jacko continued.

“Penguins, Dad!” Olivia said.

“Six hundred is my limit,” Tom insisted.

“If we can come too, we can chip in the difference,” Hans said.

Matt was shaking his head this entire time but Jacko’s wolfish grin only widened. “I think we have a deal, then, mates.”
