## Chapter 4

The convoy of vehicles stopped at a decrepit wooden jetty poking a bony limb into the bay. The ferry was a flat-bottomed vessel with a diesel engine, a tiny little foul-weather cabin, and a ramp at each end. Very similar to the small ferries you saw on Puget Sound.

Ivan, the ferry pilot, was a tall, powerfully built man in his fifties with long graying blond hair and boozy green eyes. He was smoking and wearing heavy denim overalls despite the heat. He’d been surprised to see three cars but when Jacko gave him three hundred bucks, he tucked it into his pocket and nodded.

Tom drove on first, followed by the Dutch couple and the Toyota.

They got out of their cars while Ivan unhooked the two hawsers tying the ferry to the shore. He used a stick to fend the ferry away from a bunch of old tires protecting the dock and then he put the diesel engine into gear and they were away.

“If you want to see sharks, I’d go to the port side. That’s the left side for you landlubbers,” Ivan said as he stubbed out one cigarette and lit another and Jacko took the tiller.

They went to the port side and caught a glimpse of a tiger shark’s fin, which made Owen favor everyone with a smile. “How big is the island?” Tom asked.

“Four kilometers lengthwise,” Ivan said. “In old money, that’s about three miles wide, and it’s two from top to bottom.”

“Where are the koalas?” Heather asked.

Matt came over from the leeward rail. He had taken his hat off. With his long chestnut hair, Heather thought he looked like one of those men a woman in a ’90s Tampax commercial would be riding her horse to meet. “The koalas will be in the trees,” Matt said. “Look, don’t drive far from the dock. There’s no internet or Wi-Fi and it’s easy to get lost. Definitely stay away from the farm—that’s in the middle of the island.”

“I would like to see an Australian farm,” Tom said.

“No!” Matt said. “You’re not supposed to be on the island at all. Nothing to see, anyway. It’s just a hobby farm now. Sheep, goats, generator, a well. Just for us. Just for the family.”

“So how do you live?” Tom asked.

“The federal government had a prison just down the road here from the 1910s to the 1980s. They paid us rent and we sort of live off the remains of that cash. They tried to run it as a tourist attraction after it closed, but Ma put a stop to all that.”

“She bloody did,” Ivan grumbled.

“Over here! Another shark!” Owen said, taking Tom’s arm and leading him to the front of the ferry with Olivia. Hans followed them, leaving Matt alone with the two women.

“How many people are there on the island?” Petra asked Matt after a time.

“Including the kids, about twenty-five, twenty-seven, I think.”

“Do you have a school?” Heather asked.

“The older kids go to boarding school. The younger ones are homeschooled, if you know what that is.”

Heather smiled. “I do. I was homeschooled.”

“In Seattle? I thought that was a big city,” Matt said, becoming, perhaps, slightly more friendly.

“I just moved to Seattle a few years ago. I grew up on a small island myself. Goose Island in Puget Sound.”

“What was that like?” Petra asked, genuinely curious.

“We moved there when I was little. After my parents got out of the army. It’s sort of an artists’ colony,” Heather said, digging the experience of telling perfect strangers some of her story. “It was founded in the 1970s but it attracted a lot of ex-servicemen, army veterans with PTSD, that kind of stuff. They have art therapy. And nature. And it’s real quiet. It, um, got a bit too small for me, so I moved to Seattle.”

“I did exactly the opposite,” Matt said. “Like your folks. I moved here. I married in. I’m not one of Ma’s sons. I’m a son-in-law.”

“It’s a bit, um, off the beaten track?” Petra suggested.

“That’s the point,” Matt said. “I grew up in a flat in Melbourne. Single mum. The trams, the cars, people yelling. Does my head in, the city. I came here with Tara, Ma’s second youngest. But she and Ma fought like cats and cats. She buggered off and I stayed. I learned bushcraft out here and I can see a hundred different birds on a morning walk.”

“Bushcraft? Birds? You and my dad would get on famously,” Heather said.

“Sounds like we would. That’s not your dad with you, is it?” Matt asked.

“No! Tom’s my husband!” Heather said, coloring.

“You seem barely old enough to have children,” Petra said.

Heather looked at Tom and the kids. “I’m his second wife. His first, Judith, died a year ago,” she said quietly.

“Oh no, poor little things,” Petra said. “But I am sure you are a comfort to them.”

I try, Heather mouthed but did not say.

Matt tried and failed to light a cigarette. Heather lent him her Zippo, and the cigarette caught.

“Is there an Aboriginal heritage here?” Petra asked.

“No. Look, this is not a tourist destination,” Matt insisted.

“We took care of them lot. We did a black line on the bastards,” Jacko said as he and Ivan swapped places at the tiller.

“Black line?” Heather asked.

“You know about the Black Line of Tasmania, of course?” Jacko said.

Heather and Petra shook their heads.

“Two thousand men under Major Sholto Douglas marched across Tasmania to capture all the remaining Aboriginals. Killed the lot of them,” Jacko said gleefully. “They did the same here on Dutch Island soon thereafter.”

“And the dream lines?” Petra asked.

“We had one come here a few years ago spouting that nonsense. Remember that, Matt?” Jacko said.

“I remember,” Matt said.

“He comes here and he tells us that because we have no natives, we’re a land without a Dreaming. The nerve of him. What a bloody fraud. Ma saw right through him. All his talk about demons and bunyips. Ma had me and Ivan chase him off with our shotguns! Should have seen him run!” Jacko cackled.

“Oh, dear,” Petra said and she looked at Heather, whose eyes widened with alarm. Heather’s feeling of unease was growing as the ferry chugged inexorably closer to shore. To distract herself, she watched as Ivan steered the tiller with his foot and cast a fishing line into the water.

“What is he fishing for?” Heather found herself wondering out loud.

“If sharks are here, it’s probably big fish like salmon and tuna,” Petra said.

“Do you fish, Petra?” Heather asked.

“Oh, yes. Hans and I go fly-fishing in Germany,” Petra said. “You?”

“Not anymore. My dad grew up fly-fishing in Kentucky, but, gosh, the real fisherfolk in my family are from my mom’s side. Her mom—my grandmother—grew up on the Makah Reservation. Mom said they could fish anything out of the sea. Whales, even.”

“He better stop fishing now. We’re getting close,” Matt said. “Last chance for the dunny, everyone.”

Olivia tugged Heather’s sleeve. Heather put up her hand like a kid in school. “Is dunny ‘toilet,’ by any chance?” she asked Matt.

Matt grinned at her. “Yeah, mate, just inside the little cabin there. Make sure you turn on the light and check for spiders before you sit down.”

Olivia looked at Heather and shook her head.

“What spiders should we look out for?” Heather asked.

“Follow me, I’ll check for you. Redbacks. Real nasty, they are. Hide under the toilet seat sometimes. Can kill you in some circumstances.” Matt walked over to the tiny little toilet, opened the door, and had a look around. “You’re safe,” he said.

“What the hell is that?” Olivia asked, pointing at a massive spider on the far side of the wall. It was a brown hairy thing as big as her hand.

“Oh, those are harmless. It’s a huntsman spider. Actually, they do us a big favor. Eat the flies. They won’t hurt you,” Matt said.

Olivia was not reassured in the least. “I’ll hold it,” she said.

“Are you sure, honey?” Heather asked.

“Yes!” Olivia said, embarrassed now. She folded her arms and stomped to the prow of the boat to be with Owen and her father.

“Is the bathroom OK?” Petra asked Heather.

“If you have a problem with spiders, it might not be a great idea,” Heather said.

Matt took over steering duties while Ivan joined Jacko at the front of the boat. Jacko gave Heather the creeps and she couldn’t help but notice both men ogling Olivia. She hadn’t been sure at first but then she saw Jacko nudge Ivan in the ribs as Olivia bent over to pick something up off the deck. Heather could handle those looks with a contemptuous eye-roll or a cutting remark, but Olivia wasn’t used to this kind of creepy attention from older men. Blue eyes, long legs, blond hair, pretty face—she would be a heartbreaker in three or four years. But not now. Heather was going to say something but fortunately they were getting very close to shore and both men got busy with fending the ferry off as Matt killed the engine and it glided toward a concrete slipway.

“All right, folks, in your vehicles! Be no more than half an hour, forty-five minutes tops, and I’ll take you back,” Ivan announced as he lowered the ferry’s ramp.

“Yeah, get your koala pics and go before Ma rumbles ya,” Jacko muttered.

“Be careful, and seriously, don’t be long!” Matt added to Heather.

They got in the Porsche and set out to explore the island. Heather was relieved to be back in the air-conditioning; Australia was her first experience of a hot-weather climate and she had decided that she did not much care for it. The road wound east from the ferry pier. The landscape was not inspiring. There were no koalas anywhere, just a large grassy heathland that had been burned in a recent bushfire and the occasional eucalyptus tree with a crow in it. Heather looked at the dreary yellow-and-brown nothingness with the feeling that they had been royally conned.

“Well, this sucks!” Owen said, giving vent to what they were all feeling.

“Maybe if we go farther in?” Tom said.

“I think we’re supposed to stay close to the shore,” Heather said.

“We’ll get what we paid for,” Tom said, irritated, accelerating the Porsche.

They drove through a crossroads and came to what was presumably the remains of the old prison. A house and a few tumbledown buildings covered with lichen and moss. An emaciated gray-haired older man stepped out from the shade of one of the buildings and furiously flagged them down. Tom stopped the car and wound down his window. “What are you doing here?” the man asked, amazed.

“We, um, we’re looking for koalas and—”

“You need to leave,” the man said. “This is private land. It’s not safe. You all need to go. Now!”

Heather grabbed Tom’s knee. “I really don’t like it here.”

The man hit the Porsche with his walking stick. “Go!” he yelled.

Tom nodded and rolled the window back up. He was as spooked as the rest of them. They drove back to the crossroads.

“Which way?” Tom said, flustered.

“Left!” Owen said.

“Straight on,” Heather said.

“I think we veer right,” Tom said and took the right road, which soon became a dirt track with long grass on either side.

“Shit! Wrong way,” Tom said. They turned and drove back to the crossroads again.

“The ferry guy said to be forty-five minutes tops,” Olivia said, looking at the clock on her phone.

“Don’t worry, we’ll make that easily,” Tom said, hitting the gas. The Porsche accelerated. The road curved. The sun almost directly ahead was sinking toward the horizon. Something blue caught Heather’s eye. “Look out!” Heather screamed.

A woman in a blue dress riding a bike had come out from a side road, completely oblivious to the Porsche bearing down on her. Heather had a momentary feeling of weightlessness. It wasn’t that the car had lifted off the ground or anything like that; the Porsche SUV was totally safe. This feeling was from another branch of physics entirely. This was the feeling that her life had gone into one of those multiverses Tom was always going on about. In one universe Tom had called the car-rental place five minutes earlier and they’d gotten the Porsche with the radar and the accident-avoidance system. In this universe Heather yelled “Tom!” as the front of the SUV completely enveloped the woman on the bicycle.
