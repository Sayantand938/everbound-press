## Chapter 5

The disc brakes were powerful but the Porsche had been going too fast and it had too much momentum.

“Oh, sweet Jesus!” Tom cried as the Porsche plowed over the bicycle with a sickening thud. They scraped and slid along the ground for twenty yards before skidding into a drainage ditch. The airbags inflated and Heather was jolted back by her seat belt. They came to a stop as the wheels spun and the engine died.

Heather opened her eyes.

The world was tilted thirty degrees from the horizontal. Tall white grass on either side of the road. The woman and the bicycle were nowhere to be seen. The airbag was slowly deflating in front of her.

Heather’s neck was wrenched and she had dug the nails of her left hand into her wrist. Her dad and mom had taught her about self-triage. She inventoried herself for bleeding or broken bones but she knew she was basically OK. She disengaged the seat belt and turned around to look at the kids.

The side airbags in the back seat had inflated and deflated. Olivia was dazed but looked OK. Owen had cut his cheek on his seat belt.

“Are you OK, Owen?” she asked.

His eyes found hers and he nodded.

“Say it. Tell me if you’re OK or not.”

“I’m OK,” he said.

“Good. Olivia, are you OK?”

Olivia nodded. “I think so. What happened?”

“Did we hit something?” Owen asked.

Heather looked at Tom. His airbag was wedging him into his seat. His side of the car had entered the ditch, and his body was angled away from her.

“Tom? Tom! Are you hurt?” she asked.

“What? No…not…hurt. Head…window.” He groaned.

“Let me see.”

He had banged his head against the window and had a scrape on his forehead; he was clearly stunned, perhaps concussed.

For the past six months Tom had done everything for her. Opened doors, paid bills, argued with waiters, cleared her credit card debt, done almost all of the driving, and certainly handled all the emergencies. But he would need a few minutes to recover and the kids couldn’t—

She would have to—

“I’ll get out,” she said. “Kids, I want both of you to stay in the car for now. Both of you take your seat belts off. Olivia, help your brother.”

Heather’s shoulder ached where the seat belt had smacked into her. She pushed aside the deflated airbag and found the handle to open the door. Her fingers tingled and her arm felt like rubber. She pushed the door and nothing happened. She pushed harder and still nothing. She kicked the bastard and it opened.

The heat hit her like a wave.

She’d forgotten the heat. The AC must have really been cranking.

She got out of the car and fell onto the road. Her hands burned on the asphalt.

Getting up, she took a breath and then hobbled around to the front of the SUV. The woman was not there. A faint hope coursed through her. She scanned the grass on either side of the road. It was tempting to think that Tom had somehow avoided the woman but Heather knew that was not the case. She had felt the crump of the bike under the tires.

She got down on one knee and looked beneath the SUV, and there was the bicycle, under the back left wheel. She hurried back behind the car and saw the woman’s body, horribly mangled, another ten feet down the road.

She ran and knelt beside her. “Are you…oh my God.”

Both of her legs were twisted underneath her in an unnatural position that legs could not possibly go. She was bleeding through the blue dress. Heather lifted the dress and saw a massive scrape across her chest but no obvious penetrating wound. She did not appear to be breathing.

“Oh my God, I am so sorry! Oh no, I am so, so sorry. You poor…we didn’t see…oh my God…”

Blood was oozing from her nose and mouth.

She needed a doctor. “Tom! Get out here!”

Heather put her hand on the woman’s neck and counted off ten seconds, but there was no trace of a pulse. She gently tilted the woman’s head back, put two fingers in her mouth, and cleared it of blood and broken teeth and a hunk of flesh.

“Come on, please…” Heather said and breathed.

She tried to blow air into the woman’s lungs but it came back into her own mouth as an unholy reflection of lifegiving air: acrid, warm, stale, reeking of blood. Something was blocking the windpipe. She lifted the limp body. “It’s going to be OK,” she said.

She thumped the woman’s back and another chunk of flesh fell from her lips.

“Tom! I need you! Get out here!”

Heather laid her on the ground again and gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and this time the air did seem to reach what was left of the woman’s lungs.

Heather began doing chest compressions.

She did this for a count of twenty and then checked the pulse.

Nothing.

Blood was pouring from her ears, eyes, mouth, nostrils.

Flies were beginning to land on her.

“Shit.” All Heather was doing was moving blood around a dead woman’s body. She was not going to be able to save her. Only medical professionals with a trauma team and blood products and—

She took the phone out of her jeans and dialed 911.

No, not 911. What was the Australian—000.

She dialed 000. There was no signal. She held the phone up as high as it would go. No signal.

She ran to the front of the car and climbed across the scalding-hot hood, burning her hands as she scaled it.

Tom was staring at her through the windshield, dazed. The kids were stirring behind him.

“Check on the kids and get out here!” she said.

Tom looked at her, baffled for a moment, and then nodded.

Heather looked at the phone. No service, it said.

The farm Matt had talked about couldn’t be too far away. Would they have a phone? Didn’t Matt say that they didn’t have phones here, or was she misremembering that?

She jumped off the hood and ran back to the woman.

She tried pumping her chest again.

She tried and tried.

Blood poured from the woman’s mouth by the cupful.

Heather stopped what she was doing.

The woman’s entire chest cavity must be filled with blood. A major blood vessel had probably ruptured. There was nothing she could do. There was nothing anyone could do. The impact had killed her and she’d surely been brain-dead for minutes now.

There had never been a possibility of saving her.

Heather tugged the blue dress back down over the body. What a kind, lovely, gentle face the woman had. Someone’s daughter, sister, wife. A young life wiped out by them.

“I’m so sorry. We didn’t see you. Oh God, I’m so sorry,” she said as tears filled her eyes.

Heather heard a noise behind her—Tom getting out of the car. He finally appeared next to her covered with dirt. He must have climbed out the window on his side of the car and scrambled to her along the ditch.

“Oh my God!” he said. “What have I done!”

“It wasn’t your fault. She came out of nowhere.”

“I honked the horn! Didn’t I? My God. She didn’t even look around!”

“There was nothing you could do, Tom.” She stood and tried to take his hand but he brushed her off.

“Is she dead? Are you sure?” Tom asked.

“She’s dead. She was killed instantly.”

“CPR! I’m a trained…let me see…we can…shit, look at her!”

“I thought so too. But I’ve done that. It’s too late. Tom, look, there’s nothing you could have done. You braked as soon as—”

“If we’d had the new model. The one I asked for. The accident-avoidance radar would have braked the car for us. That’s the one I wanted. I told you that!”

“I know.”

“It was you and the kids. We weren’t supposed to come here! I wanted to work on my damn speech!”

Tom’s fists were clenched. His eyes were wild, staring; he looked almost unhinged.

He didn’t get like this often but she’d seen it once or twice. His rage had taken her by surprise. She knew she had to snap him out of it quickly.

He had six inches on her. She stood on tiptoes and reached up and put her hands behind his neck and tilted his head down to look her in the eyes.

“Tom!” she said, snapping her fingers in front of his face.

“I had no idea there would be people on bicycles in this heat! Who rides a bicycle when it’s a hundred degrees? I was looking for koalas in the trees. They should have told us. Did you see any speed-limit signs? I didn’t see one.”

“There were no signs, Tom. She came out of nowhere.”

“I can save her! There’s always hope. I did rotations in the ER during my residency!” Tom said and got down on his knees.

She knew there was no way he was going to believe she was dead until he saw it for himself.

She looked up and down the road. There were no cars. No one was coming.

Yet.

She examined the Porsche. Both wheels were in the ditch, but it was a narrow trench, less than a foot across and only two feet deep. They should be able to get going again pretty quickly. They would almost certainly have to push the car out, though. Important to lighten the weight. She would drive and Tom would have to push. The kids could help. Owen was strong, and Olivia, with those long legs, could add to the leverage.

Tom had begun CPR.

She let him try it for a minute.

“It’s not working,” he said.

“She’s dead, Tom.”

“I was driving too fast. That guy spooked me. And I was looking out the window and driving too fast. We have to call the police. An ambulance,” he said.

“It’s too late for all that now. There’s nothing anyone can do.”

Tom stood and tried to get a signal on his phone.

Heather walked to the Porsche, opened the hatchback, and rummaged for the beach blanket. She grabbed it and checked on the kids, who were still fumbling with the airbags and their seat belts. She walked back to Tom and draped the blanket over the woman.

Heather looked up and down the road again. Still empty.

She considered the situation.

What she was thinking now was the wrong thing to do.

Absolutely the wrong thing to do.

Legally.

Morally.

It was a crime called a hit-and-run.

Tom had killed the woman. And now she was going to compound the horror of this act. It felt plain wrong. But all her instincts told her that this was the only option.

She tried to think what her mom would tell her to do.

Her mom, she decided, would tell her to wait for the authorities.

Her dad would tell her to get the hell out of there.

She returned to the Porsche and opened the rear door. She leaned in and unbuckled Olivia’s seat belt.

“Are you OK, honey?” she asked.

Olivia nodded and then shook her head. “My arm hurts.”

“Let me see.”

The seat belt had scraped her arm. It wasn’t broken. “I’ll get a Band-Aid on that in a minute. Let me help you out. Take your water bottle.”

She took Olivia’s hand and tugged her out of the car.

“Wait by the front of the car for a bit while I get your brother.”

“What happened?”

“There’s been an accident. I want you to wait by the front of the car. I know it’s hot. Can you do that for me?”

“Yes,” Olivia said, still dazed.

Getting Owen out was trickier. He was practically catatonic. He had retreated behind his “wall,” which was a thing he’d been doing since his mother’s death that Heather had never really got a grip on.

“Olivia, you need to help me with Owen.”

“Owen! It’s me! Come on,” Olivia said and they bundled him out together.

Heather walked back to Tom. “I’ve got the kids out of the car. You three can push, and I’ll drive us out of the ditch,” she said.

“At that farm place, they might have a radio. We could call an air ambulance,” Tom suggested.

“No, Tom. The impact killed her, and you…we ran her over. Her lungs and internal organs are crushed. I know you know that. There’s nothing anyone can do now.”

Tom still looked dazed, but he was nodding.

This was the moment.

Heather had to make the decision now. It was her call and she knew Tom would go along with it.

But what was the right course of action?

Her moral compass and survival instincts were swinging in wildly opposite directions.

“Look, honey, you met those people,” she began. “It’s all one family on this island. They control the ferry, which is our only way off. We have no phone service. We can’t get help. We’re entirely dependent on them.”

“So?”

“You heard what Jacko said about the police. He told me they chased someone off the island with shotguns. It sounds like they’re a law unto themselves here.”

“What—what are you suggesting?” Tom asked.

Heather looked at him. Tom was older, yes; he had read more, yes; but he moved in very small circles. He came from money, and his experience of human nature was surprisingly limited. One night sleeping rough in the Tacoma bus station would have taught him more than a thousand books.

“We hide her in the long grass with her bike. We get the car out of the ditch and we drive down to the ferry and get off this island as soon as possible. When we’re safely back on the mainland, we can tell the cops that we may have hit something when we were driving. We thought it was an animal but we’re not sure.”

“You want us—me—to leave the scene of an accident? An accident we caused?”

She looked into his eyes. The pupils were big. His hands were shaking. He was somewhere else again.

“What’s h-happened?” Olivia asked. Her curiosity had gotten the better of her and she’d come to see what was going on. Owen was ten feet behind her. “Is that blood?”

Heather turned. “Go back to the front of the car, please, Olivia. Take your brother.”

“Is someone dead?” Olivia said, her hand up against her mouth. She was pale, trembling, scared.

“Damn right someone’s dead,” Tom muttered.

Heather winced, took Olivia by the hand, grabbed Owen by the arm, and escorted them to the front of the Porsche.

“There’s been an accident. You two will have to be brave, OK?” she said softly.

She noticed that there was blood and a dent on the Porsche’s snorkel. They’d have to get that clean before they returned it to the car dealership. The big stainless-steel bumper at the front of the car was dented too; not badly, but it would still need to be explained.

Owen shook off her hand. “Dad killed her, didn’t he? He killed her,” he said strangely, distantly, as if from the bottom of a well. Owen, like Olivia, was both older and younger than his years. He was twelve, sometimes going on fifteen, sometimes a scared little boy.

Heather walked back to Tom.

“How are the kids?” he asked.

“The kids are going to be OK. Look, you did your best. You braked. You honked the horn.”

“Yes,” Tom exclaimed. “Yes, I honked the horn. And this wasn’t the car that I wanted. I wanted the other one.”

“You did everything you could. This wasn’t our fault. I think we should go now. I think we should get in the car and get to the ferry as quickly as possible.”

Tom nodded.

“We’ll get the body off the road and drive to the ferry,” Heather said.

“We really shouldn’t do that. It’s a crime,” Tom said.

“I don’t think we have a choice. They’re scary people. They have guns. It’s all one family. Do you trust them to call the cops?”

He thought about it. “I can see what you’re…but this is a huge decision,” Tom said. She noticed that the sweat was pouring off him. And the graze on his forehead was bleeding.

“You know what? It’s my fault, Tom. I’m making the decision,” Heather said. “You banged your head. This is my call, OK? You don’t have to think about any of this right now. All you have to do is help me get the body off the road. We’re going to put her in that long grass over there.”

“You want us to actually move her?”

“We have to. You’re going to take her by the ankles and we’re going to put her in the grass. OK?”

Tom got down on his knees and bent back the woman’s legs. They made a grotesque cracking noise that chilled the blood. Tom lifted the woman’s ankles, and Heather picked her up by the shoulders. Sticky warm blood oozed between her fingers. And now the flies were beginning to congregate en masse. They landed on Heather’s hands and arms and on the dead woman’s face.

“Are you sure about this?” Tom asked. “You don’t ever move a body. I remember when I found Judith…those stairs…I didn’t want the kids to think she’d done it on purpose. I wanted to change things. Hide the glass, hide the whiskey bottle. But I had to leave everything the way I found it…we shouldn’t be doing this.”

“We’ve already moved her. It’s too late now. Just go a few steps back. It’s easy. Please, Tom, do it now, I can’t hold her forever! Go!”

Tom began backing up toward the heath.

“That’s it, over the ditch and into the grass.”

Getting over the ditch was tricky but they managed it. They laid the woman down in the long, white dry grass. “Now the bike,” Heather said.

They dragged the front wheel of the bike from under the back tire of the Porsche. They carried the wrecked bike into the grass and hid it too. Heather adjusted some of the kangaroo grass stems, making them vertical again to hide their trail.

She ran back to the road and threw the bigger fragments of the bicycle into the grass. There was blood and smaller bike parts, but they couldn’t do anything about that. Heather closed her eyes for a few seconds and then opened them and tried to find where they had hidden the body in the heath. You couldn’t see a thing. Especially from a moving car.

She wiped the blood from her hands onto the blanket as best as she could. She wiped Tom’s hands and forehead. Their fingernails were filthy and they smelled putrid. Blackflies and mosquitoes were landing on them with impunity.

“OK, now we just have to get out of here,” Heather said as calmly as she could while putting the blanket back in the trunk of the Porsche. “Kids, I need you to help your dad push the car out of the ditch,” she said, leading them to the back of the car.

“What happened to that lady?” Olivia said.

“We’re moving her out of the sun and then we’re going to call the police,” Heather said.

“Do you know what you’re doing, Heather?” Olivia asked. “Shouldn’t we get an ambulance or something?”

“Yes, we’ll get an ambulance later, Olivia,” Heather said. “We just need to get the car going. Tom, please come here and show the kids what to do. I’ll drive.”

“I should drive,” Tom said.

“No, I’m lighter than you and you’re stronger than me. You push and I’ll drive.”

“That makes sense,” he said.

Heather walked along the ditch and got in the driver’s side. She adjusted the rearview and caught a glimpse of her own face.

Where had this Heather come from? Had this Heather been lurking there the whole time? Was it just because Tom was concussed and she had to step up, or was this always part of her? Adrenaline was some of it. When that wore off, she’d probably become a wreck.

She engaged the traction control and switched it to low gear mode. Her old Honda was a manual and she was comfortable with clutch and stick. This wouldn’t be difficult. She hit the ignition button and the Porsche started.

“Everyone ready?” she asked.

“Yes,” Tom said.

“Push!” she yelled and applied pressure to the gas pedal.

The wheels spun in the ditch and the car didn’t move.

“Did you switch on the traction control?” Tom shouted.

“Yes! Keep pushing,” Heather replied.

They shoved, and the front wheel began to crawl its way out of the ditch. She kept the steering wheel steady, and ever so slowly the heavy vehicle climbed out onto the road.

They were perpendicular to any oncoming traffic. “Get in! Get the kids in!” Heather said. Tom jumped in the front passenger seat. The kids got in the back.

Now all she had to do was turn the—

Something in her field of view.

Another car was coming. A Toyota. One of the vehicles from the farm. She was never going to be able to turn in time. Shit. Another thirty seconds and no one would have been the wiser…

She turned the Porsche onto the left side of the road, and the Toyota pulled up next to them. A window wound down. It was Jacko and Matt.

“Hi,” Heather said.

“What happened to you lot?” Matt asked.

“Nothing. Just turning,” Heather said.

“Did you go in the sheugh?” Jacko asked.

“The what?”

“Ma calls it the sheugh. That ditch. Did you go in it?”

“Yes, but we’re OK now,” Heather said.

“Your airbags went off,” Matt said.

“They did,” Heather said. “Car is so sensitive—we weren’t even going fast…anyway, we’re fine, thank you for stopping. We better go if we’re going to catch the ferry,” Heather said.

“Is your husband OK? You OK, mate? You look like shit. You hit your head?” Matt asked.

“I’m fine,” Tom said.

“What about the kiddies?”

“They’re fine. Everyone is fine. We just better go get that ferry.”

“Yeah, you should go,” Matt agreed.

“We will. Thank you.”

“You didn’t see Ellen by any chance? A girl on a bike?” Jacko asked.

“No,” Tom said quickly.

“We didn’t see anyone,” Heather added. “Well, I guess we better go. Bye.”

She wound the window up and waved and began driving down the road.

In the rearview she saw Jacko and Matt sit in the car for a moment before Matt opened the door and got out.

She saw him get down on one knee and begin looking at the ground before she lost sight of him at the bend in the road.

“Shit,” Heather muttered and hit the gas pedal hard. “Seat belts, everyone!” she called and drove the Porsche at seventy miles an hour in the direction of the ferry pier.

They reached the ferry terminal in two minutes, and fortunately the ferry was there.

She slowed the Porsche and fixed a smile on her face.

“No one say anything, OK?” she said, looking at Tom and then turning around to the kids. “No one say anything. We’ll sort this out when we’re over the water.”

She waved to Ivan, pulled the car to a stop, and wound the window down as he came over.

“Hi there!” she said.

“You see a koala or two?” Ivan asked, leaning into the car window. It was then that Heather noticed he had a black-and-yellow object attached to his overalls. It was a walkie-talkie.

“Oh, yes,” Heather assured him.

Ivan picked his nose and sighed. “So you’re going to drive onto the ferry? Not your husband?”

“I’ll drive. He’s a bit tired.”

“You know, I can do it if you want. Never driven a Porsche before,” Ivan said.

Heather took a quick look at the blood all over the steering wheel. “No, I’m happy driving it on if you’ll guide me,” she said with a winning smile.

“Course I’ll guide you, missy. No worries. Take a little spill, did you? I see the airbags went off.”

“Not really—we just went into a ditch. The airbags are so sensitive. The rental guy warned us about it,” Heather said.

“Modern cars! Drove me old Holden Sandman thirty years, never had a problem. Kids get pics near the koalas?”

“Um, yes,” Heather said, hoping Ivan wouldn’t ask to see them.

“Evil little bastards. They can give you a nasty scratch. The koalas, I mean, not your kids! All right, I’ll put the ramp down and you just drive on slowly. Come to a full stop and put your hand brake on. What you Yanks call the emergency brake. It’s right next to your seat.”

Ivan lowered the ramp and she drove onto the ferry.

“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Ivan said.

“Not at all.”

Heather turned the engine off. Ivan put his hands into his pockets and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. He lit one.

He didn’t seem to be in any particular hurry to get going.

“Um, look, could we go over now?” Heather asked.

Ivan shook his head. “I’d just as soon wait. That Dutch couple should be along any minute. I told them to be sharpish.”

“Matt said you’d take us over now,” Heather said.

“Matt? He gets a bit big for his boots sometimes. He’s not even an O’Neill. He’s a Watson. This is my ferry and I decide when we bloody go.”

“We’re sort of rushing to get back to Melbourne. We have a dinner reservation.”

Ivan grunted and put his hands on his pockets. “I’d have to make two trips…”

Heather reached into her jeans pocket, pulled out a fifty-dollar bill, and examined it to make sure there was no blood on it.

“That would be a big hassle for you. Perhaps if I made it worth your while?” she asked, holding the bill out the window.

Ivan grinned and snatched it. “Let’s get going.”

He raised the ramp and closed the gate at the back of the ferry.

Heather looked behind her to see if she could spot any other cars coming down the road.

So far, so good.

Ivan unhooked the ropes that attached the ferry to the shore and jumped back onto the boat. He started the diesel engine.

“Should we tell him about the woman?” Olivia asked.

“No one says anything until we’re on the other side,” Heather hissed.

“Mainland Australia, here we come!” Ivan announced. “You can get out of the car if you want.”

“We’re OK,” Heather replied.

A white wake boiled behind the ferry, and Dutch Island slowly began to recede into the distance.

Heather found that she had been holding her breath.

Ivan walked up to the car window.

“Anyone tell you about the foxes? Me and Kate have been trapping the little bastards. Invasive species. Kate’s got quite the collection of skulls. They pay us for them. The state.”

“We didn’t see any foxes,” Heather said, putting her hand over the blood on the steering wheel.

“All right. Well, look, if I see any sharks I’ll let you know and you can take a pic,” Ivan said and went back to the tiller.

“I think we—” Tom began and stopped as Ivan snapped the walkie-talkie off his lapel.

“What?” Ivan was saying. “I can’t hear you. I can’t bloody hear you.”

He put the diesel engine into idle. He banged the walkie-talkie and fiddled with its dial. “I can’t hear you, mate,” he said.

Heather’s knuckles were white as she gripped the Porsche’s steering wheel. Sweat drenched the back of her T-shirt. She knew she looked like shit. Police-lineup-guilty.

“Maybe we should—” Tom began.

“No,” Heather said.

“I think I got you, mate!” Ivan said. “Speak up.”

Ivan walked to the back of the ferry and had a conversation on the walkie-talkie that Heather couldn’t hear.

She didn’t like this at all. She took out her phone and thumb-typed Help to Carolyn, the last person she had texted.

Unable to send. No wireless signal, the report came back.

Ivan clipped the radio back onto his lapel.

He picked up a sports bag, unzipped it, and removed an object.

Heather leaned over the steering wheel to see what it was.

“What’s he doing?” Olivia asked.

“I don’t know.”

Ivan walked slowly back to the driver’s-side window. He pointed an ancient-looking revolver at Heather’s face. “Hand me all your phones and then get out of the car nice and slow-like. If you do any monkey business, anything at all, I’ll shoot one of the kiddies. Do you understand me?”
