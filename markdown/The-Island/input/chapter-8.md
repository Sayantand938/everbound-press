## Chapter 8

Matt took Kate by the arm and led her away from the shearing shed.

She shook him off. “What?” she demanded.

“We can’t do this. We can’t keep these people. One of us is going to have to go over to the mainland and get a cop,” Matt said.

Kate took a step away from him.

“Are you crazy? You want me to tell Jacko you just said that? Or Ivan? Or Ma?”

“We have to think about the future, Kate. You know as well as I do that the trust fund is running out. How long can we keep this all going? Two more years? Three?”

“What’s your point?”

“That eco-lodge idea Terry had. It’s a good idea. Tourists coming over legit. Staying the night, spending money. We all benefit. But if we do this, it’s all over, isn’t it? Forget it.”

“Terry’s dead.”

“Yeah, but the idea isn’t. You agreed with it. You, me, Janey, maybe some of the others. We talk to Ma before Ivan and Jacko and that lot get her worked up.”

Kate was shaking her head. “Ma thinks you’re the golden boy, Matt. She trusts you.”

“I’m thinking of Ma. I’m thinking about what’s best for all of us. You want Jacko to run this thing? With half a jug of grog in him? Bloody Jacko?”

“They came over here. They killed Ellen. They’ll get what’s coming to them!” Kate insisted.

“This is going to end up with more people dying. Ivan told me what happened to that girl Jacko picked up in the early 2000s. Jesus! It doesn’t have to be that way. We can talk to Ma, you and me! Our whole future is at stake here. Look, when the trust’s done and the money’s gone, what will we have to fall back on? Nothing. The eco-lodge, tourism—that kind of thing could save us.”

“I don’t like this sort of talk, Matt. We’re family—we’re united,” Kate said.

“Of course we are. But we have to do what’s best for the family in the long run. Not just tonight.”

Kate considered it and then shook her head and slowly raised her shotgun. It came to rest pointing at Matt’s chest. “You have to make a decision, Matty,” she said. “Are you from over there or are you from here? Are you one of them or one of us? Which is it?”

“You wouldn’t,” Matt said, staring at the gleaming double barrels of her shotgun. A gun that had killed hundreds of rabbits, cats, foxes, and God knew what else.

“Them or us, Matthew?”

Matt took off his hat and shook his head. The hatband was drenched with sweat. He mopped his brow and nodded. “Ma took me in. Treated me like a son. It’s always going to be family first.”

Kate lowered the gun. “That’s what I had to hear, Matt. Jacko and Ivan never need to know we had this conversation. But I’ll be watching you. Just remember where your loyalties lie.”
