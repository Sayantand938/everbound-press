## Chapter 9

The kids were crying. Heather was trying to breathe. Dozens of flies were circling in slow spirals about him. Tom’s head was throbbing. They’d done this all wrong. If they’d come clean in the first place, perhaps the O’Neills wouldn’t have reacted with such hostility. He should have followed his first instincts: Confessed all. Gotten the police involved. Why had he listened to Heather? She was a Millennial. She didn’t know anything.

He shook his head.

It was too late for recriminations.

This didn’t necessarily have to be a fatal mistake. This wasn’t some hick county in America. This wasn’t the third world. This was Australia, one of the most civilized countries on Earth. They would threaten them and try to bully them, but an arrangement would be made. This very situation had happened to Thomas Edison in Germany. Edison had run over a peasant woman in his car and he had simply opened his wallet and paid off the entire—

“What’s going to happen to us?” Olivia asked softly.

“Nothing’s going to happen, sweetie. They’re just trying to intimidate us. That’s what bullies do,” Tom said.

“You killed the woman,” Owen said.

“It was an accident, Owen. I didn’t kill her. She swerved onto the road with her bike. It was an accident. It’s the sort of tragic thing that happens all the time.”

“That’s a lie. You are both liars. That’s not what happened,” Owen said, leaning forward but stopping abruptly as the ropes choked him.

Tom looked at Heather for support but she was writhing around in her jeans trying to get comfortable or doing God knew what.

“This is your fault, Heather,” Olivia cried. “We should have called the police. You don’t run away when you have an accident! Didn’t you ever learn that where you came from?”

“There was no phone signal,” Heather said.

“Now they’re going to take revenge on us,” Olivia said.

“That’s not how things work. Not in Australia. Not anywhere. They’re angry now but they’ll see reason. This is a police matter. Sooner or later they’ll call the police,” Tom insisted.

“They said there aren’t any phones here either,” Owen said.

“They’ll take the ferry over to the mainland and call from there.” Tom could see Heather still wriggling in the dirt. “What are you doing over there?” he asked.

Heather was drenched with sweat. She looked up at him. “I shoved my key chain down the front of my jeans. I think I can get it out.”

“What good will that do?”

“There’s a penknife on it,” Heather whispered. “I picked it up in Alice Springs. I thought they’d make us turn out our pockets, so I hid it.”

“Jesus!” Tom said. “You’re amazing.”

“Amazing if I can get it out,” she said as she tried to manipulate the penknife down her pant leg.

Tom’s senses heightened. Here was a plan B in the making. He looked through the cracks in the timbers. It was dark. Presumably the O’Neills would debate what to do overnight and in the morning they’d probably be more rational. But why take that risk? If they could cut through their bonds, it wouldn’t be difficult to dig under the dirt at the back of the hut. It was, what, two miles across country to the ferry? If the boat was still there and he could get its diesel engine working, they’d be across the little strait to the mainland in fifteen minutes. They were in a semi-enclosed bay—surely the currents were bound to take them ashore. If he couldn’t get the diesel engine working, they could maybe launch it anyway and drift over on the tide.

Heather had now maneuvered the penknife down her leg and out the bottom of her jeans. She grabbed it in her tied hands and opened the blade. It was a tiny little thing.

“Is it sharp?” Tom asked.

“Yes,” Heather said, testing it with her thumb. “Shall I try to throw it to you?”

“No! Don’t do that. It might land in the middle between us, and then where would we be? Cut yourself free first and then bring it over,” Tom said in a loud whisper.

Heather began sawing at the binds on her hands.

“Is it working?” Tom asked.

“I don’t know. I think so, yes,” Heather said.

“I can’t breathe, Dad,” Olivia complained.

“I’m sorry, honey. Try to put a finger between the ropes and your neck,” Tom said.

“OK,” Olivia replied, as if this were somehow a normal question and answer.

“What’ll we do if we can cut the ropes?” Owen asked.

“We’ll get ourselves free and then dig under the planks at the back of the shed. We’ll make a run for it into the undergrowth. The ferry dock is only two miles away across country. We can easily get there,” Tom said.

“And then what?” Owen asked.

“We’ll take it to the other side.”

“What if the ferry is tied up on the other side of the channel?” Owen said.

Tom winced. He hadn’t thought of that. “We’ll hide out on the island.”

“They’ll find us,” Olivia whimpered.

Tom shook his head. “No, they won’t find us.”

Tom could see that Heather had the penknife between the thumb and forefinger of her right hand. The rope was very thick hemp and she looked so awkward trying to cut it. “Is it definitely working?” he asked.

“I think so,” she said.

“Good, keep at it.”

“Can you really do this, Tom?” Heather asked him. “Hide us from them?”

“Of course I can,” he assured her.

Owen was getting excited now. “We could get rabbits. We could make spears and hunt them.”

“Don’t be dumb, Owen,” Olivia said.

“Did you tell anyone about us coming here?” Heather asked.

“No, but the GPS on our phones was working all the way through most of the peninsula, so the police will be able to track our movements and figure out where we went.”

“They won’t know we’ve come over here, though. The GPS wasn’t working on the ferry,” Heather said.

Tom didn’t need her negativity now and she had that young person’s thing of saying everything that came into her head. “Honey!” he said with mild reproach. “The police will figure it out, won’t they?”

Heather picked up on his signals. “Yes, yes, you’re right, of course. The cops will be looking for us by now and they’ll get us tomorrow.”

Tom nodded. If they stayed calm, looked around them, tried to be present, it would be OK.

“That’s right. All three of you have to trust—”

Voices, people moving toward them…

“Shit, they’re coming back, hide the knife in the dirt,” Tom said.

Heather fumbled the penknife into the floor as best she could just as the shed door opened.

“We need to talk to both of you again,” Matt said.

“We need water for the children,” Tom said.

“I’ll get you water. We decided we’d better talk to you and your wife before Danny gets here,” Matt said and began undoing the rope that tied Heather’s neck to the timber frame. Tom had an anxious moment as Matt looked at the floor near where Heather was sitting, but he didn’t see the penknife. Matt undid the rope around Tom’s neck and pulled them both to their feet.

“This is utterly disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself. You can’t keep us like this. These are little kids! What are you thinking?” Heather said to Matt.

Even in the gloomy light of the hut, Tom could see that Matt was embarrassed.

“Look, yeah, I’m sorry about all this. But I did bloody tell you not to come here,” Matt said.

“If you insist on keeping me and Tom so we can sort out some form of compensation, then so be it,” Heather said. “But you need to take the children to the mainland on the ferry.”

Tom gave her an I’ve got this look. He wanted to deescalate the situation. Heather was getting herself worked up. There was no way Ma would ever allow such a thing. “No, we don’t need you to do that. But our kids need water,” Tom said.

“I’ll bring them water. Come on,” he said. “Danny’s on the ferry. He’s nearly here.”

“I’m not leaving these children in here by themselves,” Heather said.

“I give you my word nothing’s going to happen to them. Trust me,” Matt said. He said it so sincerely that Tom believed him, and Heather found herself nodding.

“Come on, Heather,” Tom said. “Let’s be calm and we’ll go fix this.”

Kate was waiting outside the shearing shed with her shotgun. “She’s in the farmyard,” she said to Matt. “We brought Ma’s chair out.”

They trudged between the farm buildings and odd bits of machinery that resembled sinister modern-art installations.

They reached the farmyard, where the Porsche was still parked, and Tom noticed the Dutch couple’s camper van. Where were they in all this?

Ma was sitting in her rocking chair with about fifteen or twenty people gathered around her in the twilight. The flies had not dispersed when the sun set, and there was a smell of decaying kelp blowing in from the sea. Most of the adults were armed, Tom noted. Heather had better not try anything foolish.

“Danny’s coming. We better settle this now,” Ma said. “You two stand in front of me. We’re gonna sort this out like grown-ups. Fair dinkum and shake on it. Agreed?”

Tom nodded. “Of course. Once again, I am so sorry about Ellen. I apologize profusely on behalf of myself and my family.”

“Good,” Ma said. “You’ll have to apologize to Danny too. Make it a real bloody good one. He loved that girl.”

“I will. Yes. And, look, before Danny gets here, maybe we could come to an arrangement and present it to him as a fait accompli,” Tom suggested. “A fait accompli is a—”

“I know what it is!” Ma said. “I went to Mount Lourdes Grammar, didn’t I? Let’s see if we can get this sorted.”

Tom began to relax. Admittedly, Ma looked terrifying, but this was a note of compromise. The word sorted was a good sign. Also, there was a strong hint of Ireland in Ma’s voice. She must have come over here as a little girl. The matriarch of Dutch Island was not the descendant of some isolated inbred cult of pagan idol worshippers. She was just another immigrant trying to make good in a big country.

Tom gave Heather a reassuring smile. He walked closer to Ma, head bowed, hands bound in front of him like a defeated enemy. “Obviously, what happened here is a terrible tragedy. It was my fault and I’m sorry and my heart goes out to Ellen’s family and Danny.”

“Danny will be gutted,” a man said from the crowd. There was a general murmuring of agreement.

Tom bit his lip. Yes, the entire island was one large family, but Ma ran the roost. Her word would be law. All he had to do was persuade her.

“I’m very sorry about the accident, but there was nothing malicious in it. It was no one’s fault. It was just one of those things that happen,” Tom said.

“You were going too fast on that road,” Kate said, and again there was grumbling from the crowd.

Tom knew a heated dispute would be fatal to his cause. He just had to agree and appear contrite. “Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps we were going too fast,” he continued. “I did try to save her. I tried hard. I’m a doctor and I did my best. And afterward, when we saw it was no good, we just panicked. We did completely the wrong thing. Look, there’s no way we can bring back Ellen. But we can offer you, um, compensation.”

“Do you mean money?” Jacko asked.

“Yes.”

“You’re a doc. How much is in that? Me niece Maya is a nurse and she gets paid shit,” Ma said.

“I’ve been doing well lately. I made Seattle’s Best Doctors this year and, um, well, to be honest, I married into quite a bit of money,” Tom said.

“How much money?” Kate asked.

“My late wife, Judith, came from a wealthy Seattle family. Have you heard of Microsoft?”

Matt and Kate and Ivan all nodded. “We know it,” Matt said.

“Judith’s father was an early investor. We have shares and—”

“Shares! How much do you have in cash?” Ma demanded. “Here in Australia?”

“Just a few hundred dollars in Australia,” Tom admitted.

“But we can get more here tomorrow by wire transfer from America,” Heather added.

“I was coming to that. We can get money transferred here from America quite easily. A lot of money.”

“How much?” Ma asked.

Tom leaned back on his heels. Everyone was looking at him. Moths were flying into the arc lamps. The stars were coming out. The air was freshening. Temperatures were cooling—both literally and metaphorically. He had won them over with common sense and calm persuasion. The thing they didn’t teach you in medical school, bedside manner, was one of the most important skills to learn.

He had this.

Money was the key. They had moved on from revenge to money. Tom knew he had to pick the right Goldilocks amount. Not too much to seem preposterous but not too little either. “Five hundred thousand dollars. U.S. dollars,” he said.

A few oohs went through the crowd.

“Half a million bucks?” Kate said skeptically.

“I have that in my account, yes,” Tom insisted.

“How does the transfer work?” an older woman in filthy blue jeans and a ripped tank top asked. She also had a gun, an ancient-looking rifle that she was using as a walking stick.

“Yeah, how—how is that supposed to work?” Ivan demanded.

“It’s in a checking account in America. I have more in a savings account but I can transfer everything from the checking account without raising any suspicions,” he said.

“It’s a load of bollocks,” Kate said.

“How is it bollocks?” Matt asked.

“If we let them go to Melbourne to get the money, we’ll never hear from any of them again,” Kate said.

More murmuring.

“We keep the nippers here. He goes and gets the half a million in cash and brings it back. And we swap the dough for the kids. A hundred thousand to Danny in compensation for his loss, the rest split between us,” Matt said and looked at Ma for her approval.

“A hundred thousand for a dead wife!” Kate said.

“Well, like me, she wasn’t blood, was she?” Matt said.

There was some laughter from the crowd. Tom saw that the mood was changing. They were becoming more reasonable. “I think that’s fair,” Tom said.

“It might be. Ellen’s only been here a year,” Ma conceded.

“No! The kids can’t stay here as hostages. They’ll be terrified. Tom takes the kids with him and I stay here and he—” Heather began but Tom interrupted.

“For God’s sake, Heather! I’ve got this, honey. It’ll be OK. Maybe I could take Olivia with me to help sort things out. You’ll be here to look after Owen. I’ll get the cash from the bank and be back this time tomorrow. Everything will be fine. Then we can all go home. We can get this done,” Tom said.

Her brow furrowed and then she nodded. “OK.”

Ma also gave him a nod.

He began to relax a tiny bit. This might actually work.

“How do we know he’s good for the money? That’s a lot of money,” Kate said.

“Americans are rich!” someone else said.

“Look at his bloody car, you idiot. It’s a bloody Porsche, ain’t it?”

“I’m good for the money,” Tom insisted over the rising hubbub.

Ma nudged Ivan next to her. He lifted the pistol and fired it into the air.

Everyone immediately shut up. In the silence Tom could hear Heather whimpering.

“Right! Now that I have everybody’s attention,” Ma said. “First off, Dr. Thomas Baxter, if you come back with coppers, you will never see your wife or little boy again. Do you understand?”

“I completely understand,” Tom replied.

“We will have taken them to another location.”

“I understand.”

“Second off, if you come with one dollar less than five hundred thousand, the deal’s off.”

“I won’t. I’ll bring exactly that amount.”

“Third off, if, after you’ve all gone back to America, the coppers come up here asking questions about missing money, you better watch your back, matey boy. ’Cause we will tell the coppers about what you done and that will only be the start of it. We’re a big family. One of us will get to America and find you.”

“I won’t renege on the deal. This is what I wanted to do from the very beginning. I know I did something wrong. I know there’s nothing I can do to reset that. But I would have done this even if you weren’t keeping my wife and son…as…” His voice trailed off. He didn’t want to say the word hostages. This was an extraordinarily delicate situation and he didn’t want to further screw everything up with the use of inflammatory language. “As your guests,” he said.

Heather was agitated. She was normally so levelheaded; that was part of the reason he’d been attracted to her in the first place. She was the opposite of Judith in many, many ways. In the year he’d known her, she hadn’t often lost her cool, but these were extraordinary circumstances. He could not afford to let her blow it now.

“It’ll be OK, Heather, trust me,” he said softly. “Look at me, honey. Look at me. Trust me. This will work. Take a deep breath. Come on.”

She took a breath and nodded. “You’ll come back with the money?”

“Of course.”

“And you’ll make them give us food and water?”

“Yes.”

“All right.”

In the distance Tom could hear the sound of a motorbike.

“That’ll be Danny coming,” Matt said. “Do we have a deal?”

“We do from me,” Tom said.

“From us too,” Ma said. “We’re reasonable people, Dr. Baxter. We live here by ourselves. We don’t do harm to anybody. We don’t invite people to our island, but if they come, coppers or government, we expect them to be respectful.”

“Of course. We made the mistake and I’m very sorry about it.”

“We didn’t want any of this—” Ma said.

“Sorry to interrupt, Ma, but we have another issue,” Jacko said.

“What is it?” Ma asked.

“We found the Krauts and we’re keeping them up at the house, but they really want to go,” Jacko said.

“Tell them the ferry needs fixing,” Ma said.

“Gotcha,” Jacko said.

“Any other problems I have to solve?” Ma said and took a long drag of her cigarette.

“The children can’t possibly stay in that room overnight. You’ll have to move them,” Heather said.

Oh, shit. We’ve won this. Don’t cause any trouble, Tom was screaming at her telepathically.

Heather amazingly seemed to pick up on his thought. “Well, at the very least, we’ll need some bedding and something to eat and drink, and you’ll have to let us visit the bathroom, otherwise it’s going to be very unpleasant in there,” Heather said.

The motorbike was very close now. It was driving up to the farm. Everything was hushed, waiting.

A line of clouds.

The silent stars.

The silent yellow sickle moon.

“Danny’s gonna lose his shit,” Jacko muttered.

“We’ve done our parley and we made a deal,” Matt said. “Danny’s gonna have to like it or lump it.”

“Yup,” Ivan agreed. “Like Matt said, she wasn’t blood.”

The motorbike pulled to a stop in front of the farmhouse.

The eerie quiet grew deeper.

Flies.

Moths.

Vacuum.

Void.

Everyone waiting.

Suddenly there was a scream. “I reckon they told him,” Kate said.

“You might be onto something there, Katie,” Jacko said with a chuckle.

There was the sound of a scuffle, and the door to the farmhouse burst open with a gift of silver light.

There was a terrible wail, like a dog dying.

The sound of arguing.

Then silence.

A silhouette in the doorway.

Danny was carrying Ellen’s body in his arms.

“Oh, shit,” Matt whispered. “Jacko, be ready for him to do something dumb.”

Danny carried Ellen into the farmyard. Like all the O’Neills, he was tall and skinny. He had thinning red hair and dark eyes.

He looked at Tom. “Is he the one?” he asked Ma, spitting the words out.

“Take it easy there, mate, we’ve fixed this,” Jacko said.

“Yeah, they told me what you fixed,” Danny said. “You think I’m going to take your dirty money? You think I’m gonna take one cent of that? For her?”

Danny set Ellen gently on the ground. She was a rag doll, broken in a dozen places. Danny caressed her face, shaking. “She was everything. She was better than all of you lot put together and you bloody know it!” Danny said.

“I’m so sorry. I really am,” Tom said. He meant it. That poor woman. It was awful. But…but that wasn’t the issue now. The issue was what to do next.

Danny stood. His eyes were red and vacant. He pointed a finger at Tom. “You killed her!”

Tom nodded. “It was an accident. And I’m sorry. But I—I take full responsibility.”

“That’s not enough!” Danny yelled.

“Steady on, mate. We’ve agreed. You missed the meeting. We all agreed and Ma decided,” Matt said.

“Did you decide, Ma? Without me?” Danny said in a faraway monotone.

“I did. We decided. It’s for the best,” Ma replied firmly.

Danny walked over to Tom and poked him in the chest.

“I’m very sorry,” Tom said softly.

“Sorry, are you? Sorry!” Danny’s face was contorted with rage and grief. His eyes were slits of dark fury. Spittle ran down his chin. “And you’ve agreed, have you?” Danny said, still prodding Tom in the chest. “This rich bastard runs over my Ellen, an innocent who wouldn’t harm a fly. All I have in the world. And you’ve agreed that we don’t do anything about it?”

“I’m really devastated by what’s happened. She just came out of nowhere, I—” Tom began. Danny shoved him hard in the chest. Tom tripped over his own feet and fell. Danny attempted to kick him but Matt wrapped Danny up in his big arms and lifted him off the ground.

“Ma made the call, mate!” Matt said.

Tom warily got to his feet.

“You can’t decide nothing without me!” Danny screamed. “Look at her! Look what he done to her! She was beautiful. She was all I had. What am I going to do?”

“Mate, calm down, it’s going to be all right,” Matt insisted.

“How! How is it?” Danny yelled. “What about his wife? What if I do something to her?”

“No. This has nothing to do with my wife. This has nothing to do with my family. I was driving the car. This is on me,” Tom said.

“On you?”

“On me,” Tom said.

“Right, OK, OK, I understand,” Danny said, calmer now. “Put me down, Matt. It’s OK, put me down, mate.”

Matt cautiously released his grip and Danny dropped to the ground.

“Nothing can bring back Ellen. Nothing. This is what’s for the best,” Matt said.

“I understand,” Danny said. “I went out and got a job and got a wife. And you lot do nothing but sit here smoking and bitching and knocking back the grog in your trackies. And you scumbags are deciding for me?”

He went back to Ellen’s body and kissed her and held her. He took something out of his pocket. A crucifix, Tom thought, as he saw it glint in the moonlight.

No, it wasn’t a crucifix, it was a…

“Look out!” Heather yelled as Danny turned, ran at Tom, and stabbed the knife into him with such force that it nearly knocked him off his feet.

Heather screamed.

“Huhh,” Tom said as the knife penetrated deep into his right side.

“Jesus! What have you done!” Tom heard Matt yelling.

“He got what was coming to him,” Danny yelled back.

Danny pulled back the knife to stab Tom again. Before he could do it, Heather was on his back, scrambling to get her tied hands around his throat.

She has fight in her, that one, Tom thought as his legs gave way and he fell to the ground like a destringed marionette.

The ground was warm. Comforting.

The view from here was of feet and sideways farm buildings.

Heather was a tiny little thing, and Danny was, by comparison, a big man. It wasn’t a fair fight, but Ivan and Matt were stepping in.

“You bloody arsehole!” Ivan was saying.

Danny was yelling something back.

The voices were fading. Everything was fading.

The fields.

The falling stars.

The sickle moon dissolving into vapor above the Earth.

His eyes were heavy.

Four thoughts went through his failing consciousness. Four thoughts that were four words:

Judith.

Heather.

Olivia.

Owen.

He tried to surf the now but it was so hard; the now kept slipping between his fingers.

He felt a spasm of worry, anxiety, fear.

Regrets.

Mistakes.

The day was cooling.

The earth was warm.

When he closed his eyes, the world disappeared completely.

He couldn’t feel his fingertips.

He couldn’t feel his legs.

And then there was no “he” to feel anything at all.
