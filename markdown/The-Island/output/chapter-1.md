## Chapter 1

The sign showed ALICE SPRINGS 25, TENNANT CREEK 531, DARWIN 1,517.

She thought about that for a moment.

If they missed Alice, they would need to travel another five hundred kilometers (over three hundred miles) to find food, water, or gas. She looked out the windows on both sides of the empty road and saw nothing at all. The radio signal had been fading in and out for the last twenty minutes, but it seemed to be getting a bit stronger. She could hear John Lennon singing about "old flat-top" who was "moving slowly."

She could recognize almost every Beatles song from just a short part of the music or a few words. Her parents and most people on Goose Island loved John Lennon, and because they didn't have good TV and internet, music was even more important. The song finished, and a DJ started talking. "That was 'Come Together,' the first song on Abbey Road. Before that, we played 'Hey Jude.' Can anyone tell me which album 'Hey Jude' was on?"

The DJ waited for people to answer.

"It wasn't on any album, it was a seven-inch single," Heather said quietly.

"No, don't call in. This isn't a game. It's a trick question. 'Hey Jude' was never on any of the original Beatles albums, only on the collections. Well, everyone, I hope you liked the mild weather at midnight when we reached the lowest temperature of the day—thirty-six degrees centigrade, which is ninety-six point eight degrees Fahrenheit."

Tom made a noise in his sleep, and she turned down the sound. He had a busy morning coming up, and every minute of sleep would help him. She looked at the kids. They were also asleep. Owen had been using his phone until about half an hour ago, hoping to find a Wi-Fi signal in the desert. Olivia had fallen asleep much earlier. Heather made sure their seat belts were still fastened and looked back at the empty road.

She drove on.

The transmission made noise. Moths flew into the headlights. The Toyota's tires made a drumming sound on the road.

She thought that the Mad Max movies had been cleverly edited to remove the boredom of driving through the Australian outback. The area from Uluru had been like this. It made her miss the somewhat exciting morning traffic on the West Seattle Bridge. There were no other cars here, just the sound of the Toyota and the radio signal fading in and out. There were no people around, but at a road work sign, she saw big, dusty khaki machines sitting by the side of the road like sleeping giants.

She drove on and started to worry that she had made a wrong turn. There was no sign of a town or an airport. The GPS had not updated for a while, and it showed that she was lost in a large, empty space somewhere in the Northern Territory.

She felt more worried as the road got worse. She looked for any signs of life ahead or out the windows.

Nothing.

"Damn it, I must have taken the wrong turn back at the construction site—"

A big gray kangaroo suddenly appeared in the headlights.

"Shit!"

She quickly stopped the car, and the Toyota shook hard as it came to a stop. Tom and the kids were pushed forward and then pulled back by their seat belts.

Tom made a noise. Olivia made a small cry. Owen grunted. But none of them woke up.

"Wow," she said and looked at the kangaroo. It was still standing there, five feet in front of the car. Another second, and they would have had a bad accident. Her hands were shaking. It was hard to breathe. She needed some air. She put the Toyota in park, left the lights on, and turned off the engine. She opened the door and got out. The night was warm.

"Move," she said to the big kangaroo. "I can't drive if you're in the middle of the road."

It didn't move. "Move!" she said and clapped her hands.

It was still looking at the car. Why didn't it understand the simple word "move"?

"The lights might have made it blind. Turn them off," a voice said from the darkness to her right.

Heather jumped and turned to see a man standing a few steps away from her in the desert. When she learned she was going to Australia, Carolyn had warned her about the "world's most dangerous snakes and spiders," and when that didn't work, she sent her a list of movies about travelers killed in the outback by crazy people. "It's a whole type of movie, Heather! It must be based on real events," Carolyn said.

Heather had only watched one of them, Wolf Creek, but it was scary enough.

"I didn't mean to scare you," the man said. Her heart was beating fast, but the man's voice was so calm, kind, and not threatening that she felt relaxed right away.

"Um, sorry, what did you say about the lights?" she asked.

"The headlights must have made it blind. Turn them off and wait a minute," the man said.

She reached into the Toyota and turned off the lights. The man waited for a few moments and then walked onto the road. "Go on, big guy! Get out of here!" he said and clapped his hands. The kangaroo turned its head, looked at both of them as if it didn't care, and then slowly hopped away into the night.

"Well, that was something. Thank you," Heather said and held out her hand to the man. He shook it. He was about five foot six, around sixty years old, with dark, curly hair. He was wearing a red sweater with jean shorts and flip-flops. They had been in Australia for almost a week, but this was the first Aboriginal person Heather had met. Out here in the middle of nowhere.

"You're not from around here, I guess," the man said.

"No. Not at all. I'm Heather, from Seattle. In America."

"I'm Ray. I'm not from around here either. We just came for the show. My group, that is."

"Your group?"

"Yeah, we just came for the show. We come every year."

As her eyes got used to the dark, she saw that there were many people with him in the desert. It was a whole camp, maybe twenty or thirty people. Older people and young children. Most of them were sleeping, but some were sitting around the remains of a fire.

"Where are you trying to go? Alice?" Ray asked.

"I'm trying to get to the airport. If I keep going on this road—"

"No, they should have made the signs better. This road will take you on a long trip out into the bush. Just go back to the roadwork and turn right. You'll be in Alice in fifteen minutes. There won't be any traffic."

"Thank you."

Ray nodded. They stood quietly for a moment. She realized she didn't want the conversation to stop. "What's the show you're talking about?" she asked.

"The Alice Springs show. It's the biggest event of the year here. The white people don't like us being in town, but they can't stop us from coming for the show."

"What is the show? A state fair?"

Ray nodded. "Something like that, I think. It's a farm animal show, but there's food and music. Rides for the kids. People come from hundreds of miles away. It's usually in July. It's earlier this year. Groups from all over the area, even some from Queensland. My group has been walking for three days."

She looked at his "group" again in amazement. These people—grandmothers, parents, young children—had been walking across this desert for three days?

"None of the kids have met an American before. That's something for them to talk about. Do you mind if we say hello?" Ray asked.

Heather spent a few minutes meeting Ray's family—the ones who were awake. His granddaughter Nikko, his wife, Chloe. Chloe liked her earrings, and Heather asked her to take them as a gift to thank Ray for helping her. Chloe took the earrings, but Ray gave Heather a small penknife he had made.

"I'm selling these at the show. Made of Jarrah wood and meteor iron," he said.

"Meteor iron?"

"Yes. From the meteor that fell at Wilkinkarra."

The penknife had carvings of emus and kangaroos on one side and what she thought was the Milky Way on the other. It was beautiful. She shook her head. "I can't take this! It must be worth a lot—"

"I'll be lucky to get twenty dollars for each. Take it. It's a fair deal. An exchange. The earrings for the knife. See the ring at the bottom? I've been told that if you put your keys on that and put it in the tray outside the metal detector with your phone, you can even take it on a plane. They'll just think it's a key chain."

Ray insisted that she take the gift, and she accepted it. She got in the Toyota, waved goodbye, and went back to the roadwork sign. This time, she turned in the right direction for Alice. As the town got closer, the road seemed more certain. Houses and stores appeared out of the dark. She saw campfires with men and women around them. More Aboriginal people who had come for the show.

The phone found a GPS signal. The radio came back on. "At the next turn, go left for Alice Springs airport," Google Maps said in a cheerful Australian voice. Heather arrived at the airport ten minutes later. She drove to the rental-car area and turned off the engine. A sign said DO NOT FEED DINGOES, WILD DOGS, OR FERAL CATS with a picture of a sad dog and a cat that didn't care. She locked the doors and let everyone sleep a little longer.

"We're here," she said and gently shook Tom.

He stretched. "Oh, great. Thank you, honey. I would have driven! You should have woken me. Any problems?"

"Not really, but there was a big kangaroo in the road," she said, putting the penknife on her key chain.

"You saw a kangaroo and didn't wake us up? Come on, Heather!" Owen complained from the back seat before he yawned.

They woke Olivia, got their bags, and walked tiredly into the terminal. They were three hours early for the flight. Tom had never been late for a flight and didn't want to start now. The airport was empty except for a goth couple with too much makeup who didn't look like their passport photos. When Heather went through the X-ray machine, she smiled at an older female security officer.

"Goths these days, too much makeup and not enough stealing," she said. The woman thought for a second and then laughed. She let the family through.

No one took the penknife. That was good for Heather. Because it would save her life two days later.
