## Chapter 10

Heather had the thick rope around Danny’s neck and she kept pulling it tighter until Danny fell to his knees, dropping the knife.

“Stop this, Ivan!” Ma said.

Ivan grabbed Heather's hair and threw her into the dirt as if she was nothing.

“I’ll take care of her,” Danny said angrily, getting back up.

“You’ve caused enough trouble tonight, mate,” Jacko said, putting his boot on Danny’s back and pushing him down. Matt took the rifle off his shoulder and pointed it at Danny. “That’s enough, Dan!” he yelled.

Danny laughed sadly. “Oh, it’s come to this, has it? Who are you, anyway? You don’t give orders to anyone here. Especially not me.”

"I’m as much an O’Neill as anyone. And I won't let you tell me otherwise," Matt said.

Heather wasn’t interested in any of this now. She crawled towards Tom.

He was lying on his side in a pool of blood.

“We have to call an ambulance!” she cried uncontrollably.

“We have no phones here,” Kate said.

“You have to help him!” Heather yelled.

“That’s enough,” Ma said.

“No! We can still save him,” Heather said. “Please! We can help him!”

Heather grabbed Danny’s fallen knife with her tied hands and struggled to stand up. There were six guns pointed at her now.

“You have to help,” Heather begged, holding up the knife.

“You should drop it, sweetheart,” Kate said.

Ivan hit Heather on the side of the head and took the knife from her hands as she fell.

And then Kate fired her shotgun into the air and everyone stopped moving.

“Thank you, my dear,” Ma said. “This is a complete mess! I have to fix it as usual, right? Never a moment’s peace. First things first—get the bodies up to the house. Take them to the old meat locker.”

“The Germans are at the house. What about them?” Ivan said.

“Oh my God! Don’t let them see anything. And don’t let them go. Keep them here until we figure out what we’re going to do,” Ma said.

“We know what we’re going to do,” Jacko said. “We’re not letting the police have Danny.”

With difficulty, Ma got out of her rocking chair. “Does anyone listen to me around here anymore?”

“Yes, Ma,” six men said.

“Get these bodies up to the house!”

Two men picked up Tom, one holding his ankles and the other his shoulders, and carried him away. Heather was crying now. Tom was dead. Tom, who was so calm and balanced. Tom, who knew everything. What was she going to do?

Another two men took Ellen up to the house. Killer and victim together. What were their ghosts talking about?

Tom, oh my God, Tom.

Heather closed her eyes tightly.

Tried to forget the last few hours.

That lifeless face. That lifeless dark hair.

This can’t be happening.

I’m in Melbourne. Tom’s going to wake me up and we’re going to go see penguins and koalas.

She tried to open her eyes but had to wipe blood from her eyelids first.

Mosquitoes.

Upside-down moon.

Crowd of people with guns.

Black blood in the dirt where Tom died under the stars where Tom died.

A little kid pointing a toy gun at her.

Real men with real guns.

She sat up.

People talking in low voices.

Heather knew she wasn’t going to get many more chances to make them be reasonable.

“You have to let us go now. This has gone too far,” she said.

“Shut this woman up, Matthew. If she talks again without my permission, break her jaw,” Ma said.

“You hear that?” Matt said to Heather.

She nodded.

“So what are we going to do?” Ivan asked.

“Get rid of them quickly!” someone said.

“Hold on,” Danny said, wiping the dust off his clothes. “You have to ask me what to do. They belong to me. All of them.”

“You stupid person,” Kate said. “You cost us five hundred thousand. You always were a dumb idiot. Very stupid, you. Very stupid.”

“Be easy on him, Katie. Ellen’s dead,” Matt said.

“She is. She was all I had. You know that. No amount of money…” Danny’s voice faded away.

People came over to pat Danny on the back and touch him and hug him. Some took the chance to spit at, pinch, or poke Heather.

She felt herself sinking. She was very thirsty. Everything hurt. She was sitting cross-legged on the ground. A trail of blood was moving towards her through the dust. She tried to breathe. Breathing hurt. Her ribs hurt. The air was thick. Her grandmother said the dead could see us through mirrors. Maybe Tom could see her somehow. What would he tell her to do?

“If I have to be out here, can someone do something about the mosquitoes?” Ma said.

Someone lit a fire in a metal container. Cans of beer started being passed around.

“The question is: What do we do with the three of them?” Matt said.

“Kill them. No choice,” Jacko said.

“No,” Matt said. “That will cause trouble.”

“Who’s going to miss them? They’re not even Australians, none of them,” Ivan said.

“Let’s find out who’s going to miss them, Kate,” Ma said.

Kate grabbed Heather's hair and pulled her to her feet.

“Where are you from?” she asked Heather.

“What?”

Kate slapped Heather across the face. “Where are you from?”

“Seattle, Washington.”

“And what exactly were you doing here?” Kate asked.

“Tom’s here for a conference and we came to see the sights. We went to Sydney and Uluru and Melbourne, and the kids wanted to see some koalas in the countryside…”

Kate let go of her and she fell back into the dirt.

“American tourists, Ma, that’s about it,” Kate said.

“Tourists. So who will miss them, do you think?” Ma wondered aloud.

“Somebody will,” Matt said.

“Yes! Tom’s the main speaker,” Heather said. “At the, um, at the International Conference of Bone Medicine. You can’t just make us disappear. The car-rental company knows too. We had to sign forms. The best thing to do is let us go and—”

“That’s enough!” Ma said.

“No, wait, listen to me, things don’t have to—” Heather began but Kate leaned down and with her large hand squeezed Heather’s cheeks hard.

“The only witnesses are the Germans, is that right?” Ma asked.

“Our Ned was running the food stand. No one saw them follow us to the ferry except for the Germans,” Jacko said.

Ma lit a cigarette and waved for people to make space around her chair. The quiet talking gradually stopped and the crowd became silent. Heather’s head had stopped hurting, and in the silence she could hear birds resting in the distant eucalyptus trees. A jet was high above her, its white line just visible in the moonlight. Everything was moving into the future. She was too. Tom, poor Tom, would be dead forever. She had to think about herself and the kids now.

“Please. I know what you’re thinking and it’s not going to work,” Heather begged.

“You forced us into this. You killed Ellen and tried to hide it. This is your fault,” Ma said.

“Don’t make things worse. You—”

“Matt! I told you to shut that woman up,” Ma said coldly and calmly. “This is your final warning, girl. If you speak again without my permission, I’m going to have Lenny, our blacksmith, cut your tongue out with his leather-cutting scissors. Nod your head if you understand. Not one word from you. Do you understand?”

Heather nodded.

“Just the Germans, right? Matt, what if we left the car somewhere on the mainland?”

Matt nodded. “The car’s GPS will have stopped well before Stamford Bridge.”

“Jamie, could you wreck the car badly?” Ma asked someone Heather couldn’t see.

“Oh, yeah. Easy. Lots of steep drops on the Red Hill Road. Some as deep as twenty-five meters. Car goes over one of those, a little change to the fuel lines…boom.”

“What do you think, Ivan?”

He thought for a long time before finally clearing his throat. “I like the plan, Ma. The police will find the car in a few days and just think, Ah, too bad, stupid Americans forgot which side of the road to drive on,” Ivan said.

“The Melbourne police are smart, though—what if they come over here?” Kate asked.

“We don’t know anything about any Americans; we keep to ourselves.”

“Hey, look, this is my decision, isn’t it? Mine,” Danny said. “Under the old laws. They wronged me, not any of you.”

“You cost us half a million dollars, Danny! You can shut your mouth!” Ivan said.

“What is it you want, Daniel?” Ma asked.

Danny walked into the center of the circle. Someone had given him a clay drinking jug, and he took a huge drink of alcohol that was so strong, Heather could smell it from where she was lying on the ground.

“What do I want?” Danny said after a pause.

“There’s nothing they can give you now, mate,” Matt said.

“Yeah, no, look…I lost a wife and I heard there’s a girl. I want to see the girl. Bring her to me,” Danny said, wiping his mouth.

“Ivan?” Ma asked.

“Maybe not a good idea, Ma. If we’re going to do this, there can’t be any survivors,” Jacko said.

“I want my rights,” Danny insisted.

“You lost a wife, not a kid,” Matt said.

“I can’t take this violent woman. We can’t trust her,” Danny said, pointing at Heather.

Kate laughed. “You’re right. She’d cut all our throats, this one.”

“It’s my right, isn’t it?” Danny said.

“What would the police think, Ivan, if there were only three bodies?” Ma asked.

“I suppose the girl might have survived the crash, gone looking for help, got lost, and her body was never found,” Ivan said.

“It might even help us,” Jacko said. “The police will be focused on finding the missing girl over on the mainland. We won’t be part of the story.”

“Kill them all!” someone yelled.

Ma raised her hands for silence. “I’ve listened and I am going to think about my decision,” she said. “We don’t need to do anything tonight, do we, Matt?”

“No. And we don’t want to be running the ferry at night anyway. Nothing unusual,” Matt said.

“Tomorrow, if I decide that way, we can take the car over to the mainland and have Jamie crash it up the Red Hill Road. The rest of us can go to bed now. My legs hurt. I forgot my good cigarettes,” Ma continued.

“What about me?” Danny said.

“Go away, Danny!” Jacko said angrily.

“All right, we’ll let Danny take a look at the girl. Someone go get her!” Ma said.

“So the plan is we kill this one and the boy?” Kate asked, pointing towards Heather.

Heather shook her head no. This was unbelievable. They couldn’t mean that. This was all some kind of mistake. A nightmare. A—

“Maybe,” Ma said. “Where are those cigarettes?”

A little girl handed Ma a pack of cigarettes. She lit one and passed the box around.

“Where are the Germans now?”

“They’re still at the house,” Jacko said. “I told them we were getting the ferry fixed and they believed it, but then the old man said something stupid.”

“What did he say?” Matt groaned.

“He noticed the snorkel on the Porsche was bent and asked if someone had had an accident.”

“Damn!” Ma said. “You’ve really messed things up for us, haven’t you, Daniel?”

“Ellen’s dead. I want my rights.”

“You’re getting your rights, Danny,” Kate said. “But, mate, because of you we’re going to have to kill two more people to be safe.”

Heather got to her feet. “You cannot be serious about this! Have you all gone crazy?” she cried.

“I warned you! I warned you. Didn’t I warn her? Take out her tongue, Lenny,” Ma said.

A large, tanned, thin bald man began moving through the crowd. He was wearing a leather apron and a vest covered in dirt. His eyes were black; his expression was dull. He smelled strongly of dried blood and animal parts.

He grabbed Heather's head roughly and put his arm around her neck.

She punched and scratched at his arm as he pushed two huge fingers into her mouth. She bit the fingers, but it was like biting into blocks of wood.

“Yeah, I can do this. Jodie, go get me scissors, I’ll take care of her,” he said. Heather tried to scream but she couldn’t breathe or make a sound.
