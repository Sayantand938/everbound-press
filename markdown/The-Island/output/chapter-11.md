## Chapter 11

Olivia listened to the yelling. She was very scared. She didn’t know what was happening outside. She didn’t know what she should do next. They had taken her phone, but she didn't usually rely on it for answers. Most kids her age asked Google or Siri or Alexa when they wanted to know things, but she had always asked her dad. Her dad knew everything. Her dad knew everything about the world, and her mom had known the answers to any problem she’d ever had at school with friends or teachers or about how she looked. Her mom had been as smart as her dad, but she hadn’t liked to show it off as much. One of her parents had always known what was happening and what she should do next.

But her mom was dead and her father had been taken away from her.

She was left completely on her own, without her dad or her comforting blanket or her medicine.

Owen was no help.

Owen was hidden deep in his hood, saying nothing. Not even crying quietly. In the rush to leave, Heather had forgotten to give them their medicine today. She was always doing things like that. Heather was too young to be a real mom. Moms made lists and checked them and didn’t forget things. Moms looked after you. The change between Owen with ADHD and Owen who was panicky and worried was always difficult to handle. She could handle things, but Owen hadn’t had any of his medicine for a day and a half, so he was going to be in a bad state soon. It was probably better to leave him alone.

It was very hot.

Olivia’s throat hurt.

She was very thirsty.

She let the flies land on her. She was too tired to fight them now. They crawled up and down her arm.

Dad had killed that woman.

But it was Heather’s fault.

He was driving fast to impress her.

Heather was easily impressed. She wasn’t very smart. She hadn’t even finished high school. Olivia’s mom, her real mom, had a doctorate. Her real mom was a biologist.

Olivia managed to put two fingers between the ropes and her throat. It made breathing a little easier.

They had put ropes around her neck as if they were going to hang her. They probably were going to hang her. They were probably going to kill all of them. An eye for an eye—all that stuff from Sunday school.

The ropes were rough and it hurt to move. The ropes around Owen’s neck were over his hoodie. He’d been smart to do it that way. They weren’t scratching his neck. He was just sitting there as if he was dead. He wasn’t even crying. She was crying. And no one was helping. No one was going to help. Her mom was dead, her dad—

“Hello,” a voice said.

A voice right next to her.

Olivia turned, surprised. A little face was staring at her through a gap in the wooden wall. A seven- or eight-year-old girl with blond hair and big dark eyes.

“Hello,” Olivia said. “What’s your name?”

“Niamh,” the girl said. “What’s your name?”

“Olivia.”

“Is that your brother?” Niamh asked.

“Yes. He’s called Owen.”

“Hello, Owen,” the little girl said.

Owen said nothing.

“He doesn’t talk much,” Olivia explained.

“You shouldn’t be in there,” Niamh said. “This is for sheep. The sheep use it as a toilet sometimes. It’s not a place to live.”

“A toilet is a bathroom, right?” Olivia asked.

“A toilet is a toilet!” Niamh said, surprised by this question. “Where are you from?”

“We’re from America,” Olivia said.

“I know America. It’s somewhere near Sydney, I think. My dad went to Sydney. Are you sad?”

“Sad? Yes, I suppose so. I want to go home.”

“Are you sad about your dad?”

“What do you mean?”

“Are you sad that he’s dead?”

“He’s not dead,” Olivia said, feeling a sudden shock of fear.

“He is dead. What do you think happens when you die? The teacher says we go to heaven and become angels, but my dad says there’s no such place. My dad says when we die, we don’t do anything.”

“Why do you think my dad is dead?” Olivia asked.

“Because Danny stabbed him with his knife. Stabbed him really hard. All the blood came out, and then he lay down and he just stayed there doing nothing.”

“That’s not true!” Olivia said.

“It is true. They did something to your mom.”

“Lenny’s going to cut your mom’s tongue out. Lenny is going to put his big scissors in her mouth and cut out her tongue so she can’t talk back to Ma anymore. Ma didn’t like that.”

“No! None of that happened.”

“It’s true. Ma told them to take your dad and Ellen up to the old meat locker. Two dead people together. If you look through the window, you can see them on the big table. Come out and see for yourself,” Niamh said.

“Can you let me out?” Olivia asked.

“What?”

“Can you let me out?”

The girl walked around the front of the shearing shed and then came back. “They put something on the door. What do you call those metal things?”

“A padlock?”

“Yeah.”

“Is there any other way out of here?” Olivia asked.

“I don’t know. There used to be a big hole in the roof where you could see out, but they fixed that.”

“The roof is too high anyway.”

“One of the female sheep pushed her way out last winter,” Niamh said.

“Where?”

“Do you see where the wall is a different color?”

“No, it’s too dark in here to see anything.”

“Next to me, where I am. Jacko repaired it. He used wood that had floated in the sea. I don’t think it’s very strong. And it’s not painted or anything. Ivan is a better carpenter…someone coming,” Niamh said and slipped off into the shadows.

Olivia heard the key turn in the padlock. The door opened. Owen looked out from his hood.

“All right, you’re coming with me,” a man said. He was a very large man with a mustache and very black hair. He smelled strongly of sweat and alcohol. He knelt in front of Olivia and untied the rope that went from her throat to the hook above her head. He untied the other rope tying her to the wall. He pulled her to her feet by the back of her shirt.

“Where are you taking her?” Owen said.

“You be quiet, little guy, if you know what’s good for you,” the man said.

He led Olivia outside and locked the shearing-shed door.

“What’s happening?” Olivia asked.

“You’ll see soon enough,” the man said.

He walked her to the farmyard, where many people had gathered. There was a fire burning. Music.

“Wait a minute,” the man said. He fumbled with something tied to his belt. It was a clay bottle. He opened it and gave it to Olivia. She took it in her tied hands. It smelled bad.

“What is this?” she asked.

“It’s alcohol. You’re going to need it.”

“I—I don’t want it.”

“Let me help you drink it,” the man said. He opened her mouth by squeezing her face, then poured the alcohol in. She had no choice but to swallow as it burned. Her eyes were watering and her throat was burning.

She stumbled, and the man lifted her by the waist and carried her into the center of the circle. Another man was holding Heather by the neck and pushing a large pair of pliers into her mouth.

Olivia screamed, broke free from the man pulling her, and ran to Heather. She kicked the man with the pliers, and he was so surprised he let Heather go. Olivia fell into Heather’s arms.

“They killed Dad! They killed him, didn’t they?” Olivia said, crying loudly.

“I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, baby girl,” Heather said, pulling Olivia close, wrapping her tied hands around her, and hugging her as hard as she could.

Olivia buried her face in Heather’s chest. She’d never really hugged her before except that one time at the wedding, before Christmas. And that was only out of politeness.

Heather rocked her back and forth and began crying too.

“What do I do now?” the blacksmith asked.

“Leave it,” Matt said.

“Is he really dead?” Olivia whispered.

“I’m so sorry, honey. I am so, so sorry,” Heather whispered back.

“There’s the girl! I want to see her,” Danny said.

“Let him see her,” Jacko said.

Olivia felt an arm wrap around her and pull her away from Heather. Heather tried to reach for her, but the man in the leather apron pushed her down.

“What do you think, Danny?” Jacko said.

The one called Danny was staring at her. He was skinny and red and unpleasant to look at. His tongue was hanging out, and spit was dropping from his lips. He seemed very drunk. He reached out and touched her hair. Olivia flinched.

Some of the men started to laugh and someone shouted, “Go on, Danny, son!”

“How old are you?” Danny asked. His breath smelled strongly of that same alcohol the other man had given her.

“Fourteen,” she said.

The old woman with the cane was coming over now, the one they called Ma. She tilted Olivia’s head back and looked at her. Her hands were cold and damp.

“Well, Danny?” she asked.

“No one will ever replace Ellen, but it’s better than nothing,” he said.

“Life’s a balance. Nature was cruel to you today. This brings back the balance. You can take her,” Ma said.

There were a few laughs from the men gathered there.

Olivia saw that Heather was standing now. The man with the pliers moved in front of her. She went around him and took a step toward Ma. “You’ve done nothing wrong so far,” Heather said.

“What do you mean?” Matt asked.

“You haven’t done anything wrong. Nothing at all. Everything bad that’s happened has been either Tom’s fault or his fault,” she said, pointing toward Danny. “If you put us back on the mainland—”

“You’ll go to the police. Of course you will!” Ma said angrily.

“So we go to the police. But none of this affects any of you except him. You haven’t done anything,” Heather said.

“We kidnapped you,” Matt said. “We held you against your will.”

“No, you kept us safe while you tried to reach the police on the mainland. If you let him take her now, then it’s all over,” Heather insisted. “You’re going to have to kill all of us. And the Dutch couple. Are you sure you’re going to succeed with that? That’s a very big decision.”

“I made my decision,” Ma said.

“You said you were going to think about it overnight. We’re not going anywhere. We’re locked in that hut. You can decide in the morning,” Heather said.

Matt looked at Ma. “There is some truth in what she says.”

Ma leaned on her stick and shook her head. “Where does it stop? Terry’s word was the law, and that was the end of it in his day,” Ma said.

“Excuse me, but you won’t be changing any decision. You’ll just be thinking about it overnight. What difference will that make? We’re not leaving,” Heather said.

“What difference will it make to you?” Matt asked her.

Heather looked at Danny and then at Matt. “It’s my job to protect these kids,” she said quietly.

“And what about the other two?” Ma wondered. “I suppose we’ll have to keep them as well. What are we going to do with them, Matt?”

“We can decide that in the morning too,” Matt said.

Ma took a handkerchief from a pocket in her skirt. She blew her nose into it and looked at it. She looked at Matt and finished her cigarette. “I said I would think about it overnight, didn’t I?” Ma said.

“I think that’s a very good idea.”

“No! You said I could have her!” Danny cried loudly.

“And maybe I’ll say it again, but you be quiet for now, Daniel.”

“I just want my rights!” Danny said.

“And you’ll get your rights. But you’ll have to wait. All right, Jacko. Put them back in the shearing shed and lock them in. And put the Germans in there too. We’ll fix all this in the morning. If Danny gives you any trouble, have someone throw him down the well."
