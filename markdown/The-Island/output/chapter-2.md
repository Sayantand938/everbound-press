## Chapter 2

They walked a sleepy Owen and Olivia to the gate. The flight started early, and they were the only passengers in the business section; in fact, they were almost the only passengers on the whole plane. Tom was a nervous flier. You wouldn’t think from his professional appearance that he ever got nervous, but he did. When he first came to the massage clinic, Heather realized almost immediately that his back problems were not from “an old skiing injury” but tension he was holding in his shoulders and lower back. Doctors were often the most doubtful about the benefits of a good massage, but all she had to do was keep working, and he felt 80 percent better by the end of the first session. The fact that he kept coming back for massage therapy was more because of the connection they had made than any “injury.”

The flight attendants began making the safety announcements.

She patted Tom’s leg and he gave her a smile.

“I’m hungry,” Owen said.

Heather reached into her backpack and offered him a granola bar. He shook his head. “Not those ones! Oh my God, Heather, you know I hate those ones!”

“We finished all the strawberry ones. This is all we have left,” Heather said.

“Forget it, then!” Owen said. He put his headphones back on, pulled up his hood, plugged his phone into the charger, and restarted his driving game.

Heather did a little meditation while the plane taxied. Everything is the path. Her tiredness was the path, Owen’s dirty look was the path, Tom’s stress was the path, Olivia’s beautiful, sleepy face was the path.

They took off just before dawn, and the landscape from the left side of the plane was amazing, with the sun coming up over what seemed to be a huge empty red area. Australia was almost as big as America but had much fewer people. A desert of yellow-brown, red, and bright red. Huge empty areas of red earth broken by very large rock formations that looked like markers for the graves of a race of giants that died out long ago. She thought of Ray and his “mob” walking through that to get to the show. It was hard to believe.

Her eyes were heavy. I’ll just close them for a minute, she thought.

She woke when they touched down in Melbourne. She’d been dreaming about Seattle. Snow in the woods of Schmitz Park. “Where…” she began and then remembered.

The airport was like all airports, and the city from the back of a big SUV seemed like all cities. Tom was in the front talking with Jenny, the conference representative. Heather sat in the back next to Olivia, who was still sleeping lightly. Owen was awake now, deep in his book about Australian snakes, his hood pulled up, not looking out the window. At dinner parties, one of the things Tom and his Generation X friends worried about was Millennials and Generation Zers not “fully connecting with the world,” but Heather didn’t blame Owen at all for not connecting. The world had taken his lovely mother from him just before his twelfth birthday. The world had put a thin stranger who was supposed to be a “new mom” into his life. How unfair.

“As you asked, I’ve put you in an Airbnb on the beach,” Jenny said, leaning around and looking at Heather. She was a young woman in her twenties, with reddish-brown hair and a smile.

“I didn’t ask for—” Heather began.

“I asked for it, sweetie,” Tom said. “So much better than the conference hotel. I checked it out online. It’s great. A home away from home.”

“Oh, sure, that’s fine,” Heather agreed, although secretly she had been looking forward to room service and being looked after a bit while Tom did his conference work.

They drove along the sparkling Melbourne shoreline, past a lighthouse and a boat harbor. There were palm trees and a beach and a deep blue ocean.

Tom gently nudged Olivia. “This reminds me, why do you never see elephants hiding in palm trees?”

“Why?” Olivia asked sleepily.

“Because they’re very good at it.”

“No more dad jokes!” Olivia pleaded.

“I thought it was funny,” Heather whispered.

Tom chuckled, took Heather’s hand, and kissed it.

“But I wouldn’t quit doctoring to go into stand-up,” Heather added.

“Look at you, crushing my dreams,” Tom said, slapping his hand to his forehead.

“Are you enjoying Australia, Heather?” Jenny asked.

“It’s my first time ever outside of America! So, yes, it’s all very exciting,” Heather replied.

“Jet lag over?”

“Nearly, I think. We had two days in Sydney and two days in Uluru. So it’s a little easier each morning.”

“And what is it you do?” Jenny asked.

“I’m a massage therapist,” Heather said. “I mostly look after the children now, but I still have a couple of difficult clients who refuse to go to anyone else.”

“My friend Kath is a physiotherapist,” Jenny said. “Kath is very funny. The stories she has. She is strict. She makes the older people do their exercises. Kath says the difference between a physiotherapist and a terrorist is that you might have a chance of negotiating with a terrorist.”

“I’m not quite a licensed physical therapist just yet,” Heather said, although she knew Tom hated it when she mentioned that.

“Well, here’s the bay,” Jenny continued. “We’re right on it. Weather will be perfect for the beach. You like the beach, eh, kids?”

Neither of the children said anything. They turned down a quiet suburban road called Wordsworth Street and stopped at a large rectangular modern-style house.

“There’s a pool – you and the children can swim while I work,” Tom said with a big smile. He was very handsome when he smiled, Heather thought. It made him look younger. Actually, he looked great for his age. Late thirties, you would have said, though he was forty-four. There was almost no gray in his hair, and his diet kept him thin and healthy. His hair was longer now than he normally let it grow, and this morning it fell across his forehead like the wing of a young crow. According to the long article on “Seattle’s Best Doctors,” his eyes were a “serious, cold blue.” But not to her. To her they were intelligent, playful blue eyes. Loving.

Jenny helped them carry their bags to the porch. “Anyone need the toilet? Great toilets in here. Heather? Looks like you tried to hold in a fart and failed, right?”

“Er, I’m fine.”

“Great house. Nothing but the best for one of our main speakers. The guy who owns it is an unpleasant person, but his place is beautiful.”

They went inside a large open living room with leather sofas and cushions and expensive-looking rugs.

“Bedrooms are upstairs,” Jenny said. “All with sea views.”

“I have to go to the meeting,” Tom told Heather. “But I’ll be back tonight. You just relax and have fun.”

Heather kissed Tom on the cheek and wished him luck. “Take care, honey,” she added, sitting down.

Jenny smiled. “I’ll look after him. It’s my job. Any questions?”

“Um, what’s a wanker?” Heather asked.

“A compulsive masturbator,” Jenny replied.

Heather jumped up from the sofa.

“It’s not meant exactly as it sounds, sweetie,” Tom said. “It’s just a way of speaking.”

And then, suddenly, the representative and Tom were gone.

“Damn, look what Cardi B just posted!” Olivia said, showing Owen her phone.

“Oh my God. Why does she even bother? She’s just a cheap version of Nicki,” Owen said.

Olivia laughed. “That thing about Drake? Drake wouldn’t work with her.”

“Are you guys talking about Drake…the rapper?” Heather attempted.

“Seriously, Heather. Don’t even,” Olivia said. “You don’t know what we’re talking about.”

Owen was going to add to the criticism, but another big yawn took him, and then Olivia yawned too. Heather got them upstairs and led each of them to a bedroom, which, thankfully, they did not fight over.

She picked out a room for herself and Tom. It looked out over the street and the lighthouse and was decorated in a kind of Aztec style. When she checked to see if the children wanted anything to eat, she found both of them sleeping lightly on top of their beds.

Heather took off Owen’s shoes and covered him with the blanket. She did the same with Olivia and pulled the curtains closed and went back to the main bedroom. The conference organizers had provided them with what was probably an expensive bottle of red wine. She opened it and poured herself a glass, took off her easy-to-wear shoes, and took off her T-shirt and jeans. She put on a robe and was about to get into a shower when she noticed the door that led outside to a small but usable rooftop swimming pool.

Her bikini was packed away in one of the suitcases, but the rooftop was protected by a privacy wall. Heather carried the wineglass to the pool’s edge, took off the robe, and dropped into the cold blue water. She allowed herself to sink to the bottom of the pool and let the driving and the dust and her aches and pains slowly go away.

This had all been so much more stressful than she had been expecting, the children all the time with no school or friends to play with. She opened her eyes and looked at the big deep blue Australian sky through the pool water. So like a Puget Sound sky but so strangely different too.

She had been holding her breath for thirty seconds.

She had known this was going to be a tough trip, but she hadn’t realized quite how tough. These past five days, she had almost had no time for herself.

Children were like fishing lines that catch you in their unkindness and wants and sticky fingers and problems and disappointments. The idea that being a mother is always perfect made you think it was all going to be hugs and campfires and children's soccer practice, and that was all nonsense.

She burst to the top of the water at thirty-five seconds. She gasped for air and found that she was about to cry. She fought it, and the tears went away. She shook her head and climbed out of the water.

Back inside, she went through the wrong door and found herself in a very large closet that was empty except for hundreds of coat hangers. The closet had a huge mirror at the back. Heather hadn’t seen a mirror in a few days. She was drawn to it. Her mother, the painter, claimed that sadness always showed in the eyes. Heather’s green eyes looked more tired than sad. Her face had got a tan, and her hair had got a little lighter in the sun. She had lost weight, which was not a good thing because it was all muscle. She hadn’t been doing her exercises or yoga. She looked thin and weak, like one of those Manson followers, and when Tom told people she had grown up on a type of community, you could tell that they were thinking of the NXIVM group or worse. Of course, it was nothing like that.

She grabbed her phone, sat cross-legged on the floor, and dialed a number.

“Hello?” a female voice said.

“Hi, it’s me.”

“Wow, girlfriend! I was wondering if I was ever going to hear from you again. I was quite sure the hitchhiker killers or the spiders were going to get you.”

“Not yet. What time is it there, Carolyn?”

“It’s five thirty. Five thirty in the evening.”

“Here it’s the morning. Tomorrow morning, I think.”

“Man, that is strange. Seriously, are you looking out for the spiders? And did I warn you about those blue-ringed octopuses that kill you in ten seconds?”

“You did. Interestingly, very few blue-ringed octopuses in the desert,” Heather said.

“Don’t blame me when they get you. How’s the handsome husband?”

“He’s good.”

“I’ll bet he is! He’s very attractive, that one. And how are the children?” Carolyn asked.

“You shouldn’t call them that.”

“Ha! I knew you would start to feel attached to them sooner or later. Cough me an SOS in Morse code if he’s close enough to hear.”

“He’s not and everything is OK.”

“You’ll come and see me when you get back? Show me your photos, tell me everything?”

“Of course.”

“I haven’t seen you for ages.”

“The ferries—it’s complicated.”

“He doesn’t like you coming back here, does he?”

“You’re crazy.”

“It’s the drugs, isn’t it? He thinks we are all bad people. You should never have told him about our marijuana plants. And yet he gives his own children what he calls prescription drugs. They are people who say one thing but do another, these doctors, and—”

“Oh my God, Carolyn, can we change the subject? How’s everyone at home? Tell me about the Sound. What’s the weather like there?” Heather interrupted.

“Let me go to the window. You can’t see anything. Fog and rain. Light rain.”

“I dreamed it was snowing,” Heather said. “How’s Scotty?”

“He’s doing OK. He came by to see me yesterday. He just pushed open the door gently and came in. I gave him a few strokes, and he fell asleep on the mat.”

“Seen my dad?”

“Yes. He’s good. He has been out kayaking.”

“And my mom?” Heather asked.

“On her good days, she just throws paint at you as you go past.”

“And on her bad days?”

“She insists you come in and look at her art.”

“Oh, boy, I miss you guys. But I’m seeing stuff in the world now, you know?”

“Tell me! What’s Australia like?”

“It’s beautiful. Empty and red and beautiful. And the people are very friendly.”

“I’ve heard that. Look out for any of the Hemsworth brothers and give them my phone number.”

“I will,” Heather said. “Are you OK?”

“Yeah, I’m great.”

“Writing any songs?” Heather asked.

“No. You?”

“No.”

Silence down the line. A little bit of tension starting to appear in the quiet.

“You know I’m really happy for you, honey…” Carolyn said.

“I’m sensing a but coming.”

“But, man, when you left, you said you wanted to be a singer or an actress. You said you wanted to achieve great things—”

“And now I’m just a boring housewife whose dreams have failed,” Heather said.

“See? You had talent. That’s a lyric right there. Who knows where you could have gone? New York? Hollywood?”

Heather yawned. “I better go, I have to take the children to the beach soon.”

“God, he really controls you, doesn’t he? A twenty-four-hour nanny who lives with you and gets benefits, and he doesn’t have to pay you anything.”

“That’s not the way it is,” Heather said.

“Isn’t it? Be honest with me, girl. I won’t report you to the group of strict mothers.”

Heather sighed. “Well, it’s been a tough week. A tough year, in fact…it’s—”

“Spoiled rich kids, right?”

“No, look, it’s me, I guess. I was never an aunt, and you know I was never good at babysitting. No one tells you how mean they can be. I love Tom, and I’m so thankful for everything he’s done for me, but it’s just…tiring sometimes.”

“Of course it is. Even with good kids.”

“They’re not terrible and I feel bad for them…their mom—”

“You have to protect yourself, honey! It’s about you and your life. Don’t end up like the first wife, drunk and dead at the bottom of the stairs.”

“Carolyn! You know that’s nonsense. Judith had MS, balance problems—”

“Just teasing. I’ll swap lives for a bit, even with the difficult children, if you think he’d like a lively redhead.”

“He might.” Heather laughed.

“Speaking of alcohol, are you still going to that tour of a place that makes wine you talked about?”

“I don’t know. I hope so,” Heather said and yawned again. “I need sleep. Later, babes.”

“Take care, honey.”

“You too. Pet Scotty for me.”

She hung up, went to the bedroom, lay face down on the bed, and was asleep in seconds.

Owen woke her an hour later by poking her in the neck. “You were supposed to take us for ice cream,” he said.

“What? Where…oh, yeah, sure. Beach, then ice cream. Give me five minutes.”

She went to the bathroom to get ready and opened the door a little when she heard her name. “Don’t tell Heather, but I found a record player downstairs,” Olivia was saying. “A lot of records.”

“Don’t tell Dad either! I’m sure there’s classical music.”

“At least with Dad, it’s kind of suitable for his age. With Heather, it’s such typical Millennial trendy nonsense. I’m worried about the day she admits she is a Hufflepuff and asks us what Harry Potter house we are in,” Olivia said.

“Very embarrassing!” Owen agreed, and both children laughed.

Heather closed the bathroom door and allowed herself a “Little brats” under her breath. The children were already skilled young fighters in the war between generations. And really, if either of them had bothered to look at her Spotify playlists, they would have found Porridge Radio, Chance the Rapper, Vampire Weekend, Post Malone, Big Thief, the Shaggs…she sighed and realized she was never going to win this one.

The house had plenty of sunblock and beach towels. She gave Owen his Ritalin, Olivia her Lexapro, and the three of them went across the road and found themselves on St. Kilda Beach. Owen almost never took off his hoodie, but it was so warm, Heather supposed that even he would finally give in.

“Come on, let me take you both in the ocean,” she said.

“No way,” Owen said in a low voice, but Olivia followed her down to the water. Olivia was thin, like her dad, and she had her mother’s blond hair and coloring. She had been growing fast in the past year. Her mind may have been sad and not thinking clearly, but her body didn’t know that. Her body was growing taller. Fourteen, but you would have guessed sixteen or older. Heather and Olivia tried the water, but it was surprisingly cold. Owen put a toe in and gave them a look that said 'you tricked me'.

They found a café selling fish and chips and ice cream at the St. Kilda Sea Baths. Heather was sure she had not been given the correct change by almost three dollars, but she was too shy to complain about it. She felt silently annoyed with herself as they ate and walked back across the road to the house. She made sure both children showered and dried off. Olivia had finished all her homework and offered to help Owen with the astronomy worksheet for his science and nature class. Olivia had got through the past year OK, but poor Owen was having to repeat his science course. Owen refused the help, and a fight started. Heather sat them both down in front of a Godzilla movie on the TV.

She was very tired. But she knew this was the price she had to pay – to be with Tom, she had to be with the children. And she wanted to be with Tom. She loved Tom, not despite all his little strange habits, but because of them – everything about him. His intelligence, his sadness, his attention to detail, his dad humor, the way he looked at her first thing in the morning, the way he was changing himself for her. When he told her the thing about the unpleasant person, he hadn’t rolled his eyes the way the Tom of three months ago might have. He hadn’t completely stopped being condescending, but he was trying to be a better man.

She told the children she was going for a walk; she went around the block and found a 7-Eleven. The clerk told her a pack of Marlboros cost twenty dollars, and after he showed her the price sticker, she believed him. She smoked two cigarettes and listened to Starcrawler’s “Bet My Brains” on the way back home.

The children were really liking the movie.

Tom texted her several jokes to make people feel comfortable for his big conference speech with the question, Funny or not funny?

She couldn’t bring herself to text back Not funny, but she decided to remember to tell him to do one joke, maximum.

When Godzilla finished, she opened a closet marked BOARD/BORED GAMES. Both children moaned, but she insisted, and they decided on Risk. She found the record player and, ignoring the Beatles albums, put on Mozart.

When Tom came home at six p.m. looking very tired, Olivia had almost taken over the world. He sat happily on the sofa and watched, enjoying the fact that the children were doing something pleasantly old-fashioned and really enjoying it. She brought Tom a glass of wine, and as they went to the kitchen, Olivia defeated the last of the resistance in Asia.

“How was your day?” Tom asked her.

“We all had a nap and then I took the kids to the beach. How was your day?”

“Fun. I met the local important people in bone and joint surgery. We shared stories about knees. Australian knees are as bad as American knees. Thank goodness,” Tom said, kissing her.

“Did you see I won? Oh, no kissing, please!” Olivia said, proud of winning, coming into the kitchen with Owen following behind her.

Tom laughed. “Listen, I have some suggestions for dinner places. And then tomorrow, while I work on my speech, you can relax.”

“Forget chilling! We haven’t seen a single cool animal since we got here,” Owen said. “Jake said on my Instagram that he thinks I’m really in Utah.”

“I’m sure Jake was only teasing.”

“Dad, please! We can’t stay here! We have to explore a little before we go home. We have to at least see some koalas. Please, please, please!” Owen said, and even Olivia joined in with an only partly sarcastic final “please.”

“I think they have a good reason,” Heather offered.

“Didn’t you want to go to those places that make wine we talked about?” Tom asked.

Heather shook her head. “Let’s do something for the children.”

Tom nodded tiredly. “All right, I’ll think about it,” he said.
