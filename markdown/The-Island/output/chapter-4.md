## Chapter 4

The group of vehicles stopped at an old wooden dock that reached out into the bay. The ferry was a flat boat with a diesel engine, a very small cabin for bad weather, and a ramp at each end. It was very similar to the small ferries you see on Puget Sound.

Ivan, the ferry driver, was a tall, strong man in his fifties with long, graying blond hair and green eyes that looked like he drank a lot. He was smoking and wearing heavy denim work clothes despite the heat. He was surprised to see three cars, but when Jacko gave him three hundred dollars, he put it in his pocket and nodded.

Tom drove on first, followed by the Dutch couple and the Toyota.

They got out of their cars while Ivan untied the two thick ropes connecting the ferry to the shore. He used a stick to push the ferry away from some old tires protecting the dock, and then he put the diesel engine into gear, and they started moving.

“If you want to see sharks, I’d go to the left side. That’s the left side for you people who don’t know about boats,” Ivan said as he put out one cigarette and lit another, and Jacko took the steering handle.

They went to the left side and saw a quick view of a tiger shark’s fin, which made Owen smile at everyone. “How big is the island?” Tom asked.

“Four kilometers long,” Ivan said. “In old measurements, that’s about three miles wide, and it’s two from top to bottom.”

“Where are the koalas?” Heather asked.

Matt came over from the side of the boat that was protected from the wind. He had taken off his hat. With his long brown hair, Heather thought he looked like one of those men a woman in a 1990s advertisement would be riding her horse to meet. “The koalas will be in the trees,” Matt said. “Look, don’t drive far from the dock. There’s no internet or Wi-Fi, and it’s easy to get lost. Definitely stay away from the farm – that’s in the middle of the island.”

“I would like to see an Australian farm,” Tom said.

“No!” Matt said. “You’re not supposed to be on the island at all. Nothing to see, anyway. It’s just a farm for personal use now. Sheep, goats, a generator, a water well. Just for us. Just for the family.”

“So how do you live?” Tom asked.

“The government had a prison just down the road here from the 1910s to the 1980s. They paid us rent, and we sort of live off the money that is left from that time. They tried to run it as a place for tourists after it closed, but Mom stopped all that.”

“She certainly did,” Ivan said in a low voice.

“Over here! Another shark!” Owen said, taking Tom’s arm and leading him to the front of the ferry with Olivia. Hans followed them, leaving Matt alone with the two women.

“How many people are there on the island?” Petra asked Matt after some time.

“Including the children, about twenty-five, twenty-seven, I think.”

“Do you have a school?” Heather asked.

“The older children go to boarding school. The younger ones are taught at home, if you know what that is.”

Heather smiled. “I do. I was taught at home.”

“In Seattle? I thought that was a big city,” Matt said, perhaps becoming a little more friendly.

“I just moved to Seattle a few years ago. I grew up on a small island myself. Goose Island in Puget Sound.”

“What was that like?” Petra asked, truly interested.

“We moved there when I was little. After my parents got out of the army. It’s a kind of community for artists,” Heather said, enjoying telling perfect strangers some of her story. “It was started in the 1970s, but it attracted a lot of former soldiers, army veterans with serious stress after difficult experiences, that kind of thing. They have art therapy. And nature. And it’s very quiet. It, um, got a bit too small for me, so I moved to Seattle.”

“I did exactly the opposite,” Matt said. “Like your parents. I moved here. I married into the family. I’m not one of Mom’s sons. I’m a son-in-law.”

“It’s a bit, um, far from the usual places?” Petra suggested.

“That’s the point,” Matt said. “I grew up in a flat in Melbourne. Single mom. The trams, the cars, people shouting. The city makes me feel crazy. I came here with Tara, Mom’s second youngest daughter. But she and Mom argued a lot. She left, and I stayed. I learned outdoor skills here, and I can see a hundred different birds on a morning walk.”

“Outdoor skills? Birds? You and my dad would get along very well,” Heather said.

“Sounds like we would. That’s not your dad with you, is it?” Matt asked.

“No! Tom’s my husband!” Heather said, her face turning red.

“You seem barely old enough to have children,” Petra said.

Heather looked at Tom and the children. “I’m his second wife. His first, Judith, died a year ago,” she said quietly.

“Oh no, poor little things,” Petra said. “But I am sure you are a comfort to them.”

I try, Heather formed the words with her mouth but did not say them.

Matt tried and failed to light a cigarette. Heather lent him her lighter, and the cigarette lit.

“Is there a history of Aboriginal people here?” Petra asked.

“No. Look, this is not a place for tourists,” Matt insisted.

“We took care of those people. We drew a line against them,” Jacko said as he and Ivan changed places at the steering handle.

“Black line?” Heather asked.

“You know about the Black Line of Tasmania, of course?” Jacko said.

Heather and Petra shook their heads.

“Two thousand men under Major Sholto Douglas marched across Tasmania to capture all the remaining Aboriginal people. Killed all of them,” Jacko said happily. “They did the same here on Dutch Island soon after.”

“And the dream lines?” Petra asked.

“We had one come here a few years ago talking that nonsense. Remember that, Matt?” Jacko said.

“I remember,” Matt said.

“He comes here and he tells us that because we have no native people, we’re a land without a spiritual connection to the land. How rude of him. What a complete fake. Mom saw right through him. All his talk about evil spirits and water monsters. Mom had me and Ivan chase him away with our shotguns! You should have seen him run!” Jacko laughed loudly.

“Oh, dear,” Petra said, and she looked at Heather, whose eyes opened wide with worry. Heather’s feeling of being uneasy was growing as the ferry moved steadily closer to shore. To take her mind off it, she watched as Ivan steered the handle with his foot and threw a fishing line into the water.

“What is he fishing for?” Heather found herself asking out loud.

“If sharks are here, it’s probably big fish like salmon and tuna,” Petra said.

“Do you fish, Petra?” Heather asked.

“Oh, yes. Hans and I go fly-fishing in Germany,” Petra said. “You?”

“Not anymore. My dad grew up fly-fishing in Kentucky, but, wow, the real fisherfolk in my family are from my mom’s side. Her mom – my grandmother – grew up on the Makah Reservation. Mom said they could fish anything out of the sea. Even whales.”

“He better stop fishing now. We’re getting close,” Matt said. “Last chance for the toilet, everyone.”

Olivia pulled Heather’s sleeve. Heather put up her hand like a child in school. “Is dunny ‘toilet,’ by any chance?” she asked Matt.

Matt smiled at her. “Yeah, mate, just inside the little cabin there. Make sure you turn on the light and check for spiders before you sit down.”

Olivia looked at Heather and shook her head.

“What spiders should we look out for?” Heather asked.

“Follow me, I’ll check for you. Redbacks. They are really dangerous. They hide under the toilet seat sometimes. They can kill you in some situations.” Matt walked over to the very small toilet, opened the door, and looked around. “You’re safe,” he said.

“What the hell is that?” Olivia asked, pointing at a very large spider on the far side of the wall. It was a brown hairy thing as big as her hand.

“Oh, those are harmless. It’s a huntsman spider. Actually, they do us a big favor. They eat the flies. They won’t hurt you,” Matt said.

Olivia was not comforted at all. “I’ll wait,” she said.

“Are you sure, honey?” Heather asked.

“Yes!” Olivia said, feeling embarrassed now. She folded her arms and walked quickly to the front of the boat to be with Owen and her father.

“Is the bathroom OK?” Petra asked Heather.

“If you have a problem with spiders, it might not be a great idea,” Heather said.

Matt took over steering the boat while Ivan joined Jacko at the front of the boat. Jacko made Heather feel uncomfortable, and she couldn’t help but notice both men looking at Olivia in a way that made her uneasy. She hadn’t been sure at first, but then she saw Jacko nudge Ivan in the side as Olivia bent over to pick something up off the floor. Heather could handle those looks with a look of disapproval or a sharp comment, but Olivia wasn’t used to this kind of unpleasant attention from older men. Blue eyes, long legs, blond hair, pretty face – she would be a heartbreaker in three or four years. But not now. Heather was going to say something, but luckily they were getting very close to shore, and both men got busy pushing the ferry away as Matt turned off the engine, and it moved smoothly toward a concrete ramp.

“All right, everyone, get in your vehicles! Be no more than half an hour, forty-five minutes at the most, and I’ll take you back,” Ivan announced as he lowered the ferry’s ramp.

“Yeah, get your koala pictures and go before Mom finds out,” Jacko said quietly.

“Be careful, and seriously, don’t be long!” Matt added to Heather.

They got in the Porsche and started to explore the island. Heather was relieved to be back in the air conditioning; Australia was her first time in a hot climate, and she had decided that she did not like it very much. The road went east from the ferry dock. The landscape was not interesting. There were no koalas anywhere, just a large grassy area that had been burned in a recent bushfire and a few eucalyptus trees with a crow in them. Heather looked at the dull yellow and brown emptiness with the feeling that they had been completely tricked.

“Well, this is terrible!” Owen said, expressing what they were all feeling.

“Maybe if we go farther in?” Tom said.

“I think we’re supposed to stay close to the shore,” Heather said.

“We’ll get what we paid for,” Tom said, annoyed, making the Porsche go faster.

They drove through a place where two roads crossed and came to what was probably the remains of the old prison. A house and a few falling-down buildings covered with a type of plant growth. A very thin, gray-haired older man stepped out from the shade of one of the buildings and waved them down angrily. Tom stopped the car and rolled down his window. “What are you doing here?” the man asked, surprised.

“We, um, we’re looking for koalas and—”

“You need to leave,” the man said. “This is private land. It’s not safe. You all need to go. Now!”

Heather grabbed Tom’s knee. “I really don’t like it here.”

The man hit the Porsche with his walking stick. “Go!” he yelled.

Tom nodded and rolled the window back up. He was as scared as the rest of them. They drove back to the crossroads.

“Which way?” Tom said, confused.

“Left!” Owen said.

“Straight on,” Heather said.

“I think we turn right,” Tom said and took the right road, which soon became a dirt path with long grass on either side.

“Shit! Wrong way,” Tom said. They turned and drove back to the crossroads again.

“The ferry guy said to be forty-five minutes at the most,” Olivia said, looking at the clock on her phone.

“Don’t worry, we’ll make that easily,” Tom said, pressing the gas. The Porsche went faster. The road curved. The sun almost directly in front was going down toward the edge of the sky. Something blue caught Heather’s eye. “Look out!” Heather screamed.

A woman in a blue dress riding a bike had come out from a side road, completely unaware of the Porsche coming quickly toward her. Heather had a brief feeling of being weightless. It wasn’t that the car had lifted off the ground or anything like that; the Porsche SUV was completely safe. This feeling was from a different kind of experience entirely. This was the feeling that her life had gone into one of those different possible realities Tom was always talking about. In one reality, Tom had called the car-rental place five minutes earlier, and they had gotten the Porsche with the radar and the system that avoids accidents. In this reality, Heather yelled “Tom!” as the front of the SUV completely hit the woman on the bicycle.
