## Chapter 7

Ma pointed her stick at Jacko and Matt. “I didn't used to have to repeat myself around here. Get them out of my house! Get ’em out, search ’em good, put them in the old shearing shed until Danny gets back.”

Heather lay face down on the wooden floor. Her left arm was underneath her body. She reached into her pocket, took out the small penknife she’d bought in Alice Springs, and quickly pushed it down the front of her jeans. Jacko grabbed her hair painfully and pulled her to her feet. His brother Ivan pushed her towards the front door, where Kate grabbed the back of her neck and gave her another push. She stumbled down the porch steps and put her hands out to protect her face as she fell into the dirt again.

It was dusk, and the red sun had set over the mainland, leaving behind strong waves of heat. Olivia was crying. Heather got to her feet and tried to take Olivia’s hand but Jacko shoved them apart.

They were forced to walk to the old shearing shed, a wooden building about thirty feet long and ten feet wide. The door had a padlock on it. There was straw on the floor, and it smelled bad inside. It clearly hadn't been used for shearing for many years. The family was pushed inside.

“Sit!” Jacko said.

Heather sat on the floor.

“We should tie them up to be safe,” Jacko said.

“Yeah,” Kate said.

“Ma didn’t say anything about tying anyone up,” Matt said.

“Use your head, mate. Yeah, easy, we’ll tie their hands,” Ivan suggested.

“Nah, you lot are really stupid. They can still just untie themselves,” Kate said. “We have to tie them to something. Tell Freddie to get us some strong rope, I can handle this. Meanwhile, let's do what Ma told us and search them.”

“My specialty,” Jacko growled. “The police searched me so many times, I know all their tricks. Did we get their phones?”

“Yeah,” Ivan said. “No signal here, of course.”

“Grab that boy for me, will you?”

Heather saw them push Owen against one of the walls of the shed. Jacko searched his pockets and felt his legs and back. They took Owen’s money and the twenty-sided dice he always kept with him. They’d already taken Tom’s wallet and phone. They took his keys and a pen and didn’t find anything else when they searched him.

“You're next, missy,” Jacko said to Olivia.

“Could you please get one of the women to search her?” Heather asked. “She’s just a scared little girl.”

Jacko made a fist and hit Heather’s cheek. “You’re annoying me. You'd better be quiet or I’m going to break your jaw,” he said.

“You better not!” Tom said.

“Or you'll do what?” Jacko growled.

“I’m sorry, I—” Heather began.

“Didn’t I say shut up?” Jacko screamed.

Heather nodded. She was shaking all over.

“Just be gentle with the girl, mate,” Matt said to Jacko.

“I know what I’m doing,” Jacko said and patted down Olivia. He turned to Heather. “You're last, princess,” Jacko said.

“She’s the troublemaker,” someone said quietly from the doorway.

“Yeah, I know,” Jacko said and pushed her face against the shed wall. Heather felt his rough hand move up and down her legs. He reached into her jeans pockets, took her money and the cigarette pack from yesterday, patted her back pockets, and ran his hands up over her back and under her arms. “Marlboro,” Jacko said, pocketing them.

“Cigarettes?” Tom said suddenly. As if Heather’s secret smoking habit from that lost world mattered now.

“Is she clean?” Ivan asked.

“She’s clean,” Jacko said. “Now, what about tying them up?”

“Yeah, I’ve been thinking about this,” Kate said. “What do you think, guys? Tie their hands, keep them far apart, and then—see those hooks on the ceiling?”

“Yeah?”

“A rope from each of those hooks to a rope around their necks. Pull the rope tight, and that way they can’t move around in here to help untie each other. What do you think?”

“Who knew it? Kate’s a genius!” Jacko said and all the men laughed.

“This is crazy! You can’t do that to children!” Heather begged them.

Jacko turned to Tom. “She really is a troublemaker. She is going to get you and your family seriously hurt, mate, if she doesn’t stop talking.”

Heather shook her head at Tom.

“I think my wife is worried something might happen to the kids,” Tom said. “You can’t possibly think about putting ropes around the necks of small children.”

“An eye for an eye, then,” Ivan said with an unpleasant laugh.

“If you tie the rope around their waists, you can tie them to the side of the hut that way. I think that will be safer for everyone,” Tom suggested.

“Tie them to what? Those planks? No, mate. The hooks are the only way,” Kate said. “Just tell your kids not to move around too much and they won’t choke themselves to death.”

“Wait a minute! What if they stand up?” Matt said. “Your plan is rubbish, Kate.”

Kate glared at Matt. “Tie their hands, rope around the neck going to the hook, and another rope from the neck to the plank behind their head. Does that satisfy you?”

“They won’t be able to move at all.” Jacko laughed.

“That’s the idea, mate,” Kate said.

Heather watched helplessly as the children were made to sit on the floor, their hands tied in front of them, and a rope tied from each one’s neck to a hook in the ceiling. Another rope around the neck tied them to the wall of the shearing shed. Tom was next. She was last. Jacko pushed her down, tied her wrists together tightly, and put two ropes around her neck.

“Make sure it’s good and tight on her,” Ivan said. They pulled the rope almost completely tight, and she could barely move without the ropes starting to choke her.

“Maybe we should tie their hands behind their backs?” Jacko asked.

“Oh my God, why have we made this so complicated? Just leave it!” Ivan said.

“All right, mate. Everyone comfortable? Right, just wait here until Danny gets back,” Jacko said and closed the door on them, making the shed dark.
