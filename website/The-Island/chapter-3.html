<p>Tom woke up just before dawn. The expected rush of energy after a busy day meeting people had made him fall straight to sleep. Heather was breathing softly as he carefully got out of bed. He watched her for a moment or two and smiled widely. She was the best. She was so funny, relaxed, and kind. The children weren’t completely happy with her yet, but they would be. Judith would never have come to Australia, but for Heather, everything was an adventure.</p>
<p>He went to the roof, sat by the pool, and meditated for ten minutes, breathing deeply and focusing on the present moment. Then he did fifty push-ups followed by fifty sit-ups. This was a routine he had been doing since his early days in medical school as a way of calming his mind and staying focused. He could never have managed this past year without his morning habits.</p>
<p>Next, Tom went downstairs, got a drink of water, and called the car-rental place. He was annoyed to find out that the Porsche Cayenne he had booked was no longer available. He would have to take either the E-Hybrid or an older Turbo.</p>
<p>“I wanted the new Cayenne. I called about it last night,” he said, trying to control his anger.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir, we don’t have any in the lot. The customer before you got the last one. We have the Turbo or the E-Hybrid. The hybrid is our best Porsche rental, it’s—”</p>
<p>“No, thank you. It’s a long drive. I would never trust a hybrid!”</p>
<p>“We do have a BMW SUV for—”</p>
<p>“I’ll take the Turbo. Can you get it here by nine o’clock? I’d like to start early. We’re at three Wordsworth Street in St. Kilda.”</p>
<p>“Of course, sir.”</p>
<p>Tom hung up, feeling very angry. No one ever did their job right. No one.</p>
<p>He changed into shorts and a T-shirt, put on his running shoes, and went for a run along the shore. Then it was upstairs to the swimming pool. He dove into the water and swam a lap or two before coming back inside. He showered, and because the mirror was covered in steam, he shaved with the electric razor using his phone camera. He had lost weight on this trip, and it looked good on him. He looked like a young Ted Hughes.</p>
<p>“You did it, buddy. You got through the past year. I’m proud of you, partner,” he said to Phone-Camera Tom. “A paper in the Journal of Orthopedic Surgery. International conferences. Main speeches. Success at forty-four. Who would have thought it? If Judith could see you now, she’d be happy for you.”</p>
<p>Phone-Camera Tom thought about that for a second and slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>He wrapped himself in a towel and went into the bedroom. Heather appeared from a closet door he hadn’t noticed before. She was wearing a robe and listening to that “212” song she loved and he hated.</p>
<p>“Where have you been?” Tom asked.</p>
<p>“Narnia,” she said.</p>
<p>Tom grinned. “Do anything interesting?”</p>
<p>“Queen stuff…and, you know, I could take off my royal clothes pretty quickly,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“The children?”</p>
<p>“Are sleeping soundly.”</p>
<p>She took off her clothes, and he took off his clothes, and they fell onto the bed. They made love for the first time since they had left America, reaching a climax together as sunlight came through the window covers. Heather rested on Tom’s chest.</p>
<p>She kissed him on the chin. “You missed a spot when you were shaving.”</p>
<p>“I’ll fix it.”</p>
<p>“I like it. It makes you look like a trendy musician, like Zappa.”</p>
<p>Tom shook his head. “People like their doctors to look boring. Boring and calm and skilled.”</p>
<p>“You’re two of those things,” Heather said, kissing him again.</p>
<p>Tom closed his eyes. “This has been a hard year for all of us. And I’ve been trying, haven’t I?”</p>
<p>“You have,” Heather said. “We all have.”</p>
<p>“I really love you, babe,” Tom said, kissing her back.</p>
<p>“I love you too…uh-oh. Everything OK?” she asked. “Now you’ve got a worry line on your forehead.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t get the car I wanted. I wanted the new Cayenne with the advanced GPS and the rear camera and the system that avoids accidents, but they only had the—”</p>
<p>The door opened, and a sleepy Olivia came in.</p>
<p>“When are we leaving?” she asked as Heather covered herself.</p>
<p>“As soon as Owen gets up. And, look, if we really have to do this trip, we need to leave early and get back early. I’ve got to work on my speech. The conference is going to put it on YouTube,” Tom said.</p>
<p>Olivia ran into the hallway. “Get up, Owen! You’re late!” she screamed.</p>
<p>Owen made a low, angry sound in response, and a fight began. Tom quickly got out of bed, ran to the bedroom door, and closed it. The fighting sounds were immediately quieter.</p>
<p>“I thought you were going to stop that,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“Parenting 101, honey: what you can’t see or hear isn’t happening,” Tom said.</p>
<p>Despite the fighting, an hour later they were in a bright orange Porsche Cayenne heading southeast out of Melbourne on the highway. The road was big and new, cutting sharply through Melbourne’s dull eastern suburbs. The Porsche was as comfortable as you would expect, although it looked strange with a large front “snorkel” for driving through flooded rivers.</p>
<p>No flooded rivers today. They were ten thousand miles away from America, but this, Tom thought, could have been suburbs anywhere. Large stores, supermarkets, shopping areas. Interesting, though. This, he imagined, was the “real Australia,” away from the tourist areas, where people actually lived.</p>
<p>They drove down through the Mornington Peninsula, the suburbs gradually becoming fewer, and a hilly area appearing. Heather pointed out kookaburras and big black ravens on the drooping telephone wires. She took a picture of a lorikeet and sent it to Carolyn.</p>
<p>The children, however, were not interested in birds and were getting more and more annoyed. “Where are the kangaroos? Where are the stupid koalas?” Owen demanded.</p>
<p>Tom looked at him in the rearview mirror and frowned. That child was so different from his sister. If Tom had gotten a trip to Australia when he was Owen’s age, he would have enjoyed every second of it. Now Owen would be in a bad mood until they got back and he took his medicine. Tom was about to tell Owen what he thought when Heather put her hand on his leg. “Children, here’s one your dad told me yesterday,” she said. “Koalas aren’t technically bears – do you know why?”</p>
<p>“Please, Dad, don’t let her say it! Yours are bad enough!” Olivia begged.</p>
<p>“Because they don’t have the right koalifications,” Heather said as both children put their hands on their faces in frustration.</p>
<p>The road got rougher and became a single lane as they got closer to the coast. Phone signal, Siri, and Google Maps stopped working.</p>
<p>It was another hot day outside – 106 degrees – but inside the car, everyone had a water bottle from the Airbnb, and it was a cool 68.</p>
<p>It was noon now, and they hadn’t seen much of anything, and Tom wanted to get back to Melbourne to work on his main speech about knee-replacement surgery. The children were hungry, so they stopped at a little food stand. Smoke from a barbecue was trying to fight against a constant group of mosquitoes. A thin, untidy-looking older man in his fifties was selling beer and soft drinks and “sausage sizzles,” which seemed to be sausages between pieces of white bread.</p>
<p>Heather, Olivia, and Owen each got a sausage sizzle for an expensive five dollars each. Tom refused and got a can of beer instead. They sat down at a picnic table in the shade.</p>
<p>With no phone signal, Tom grabbed his very large book of Chekhov stories and plays. Owen took out his astronomy worksheet from the back pages of his snake book. He stared at it angrily for a minute or two. “This is impossible,” he said quietly at last.</p>
<p>“I can help you with that,” Olivia said.</p>
<p>“I don’t need your help!” Owen said sharply.</p>
<p>An old-looking Volkswagen camper van stopped, and a thin couple in their late fifties or early sixties got out. They got two cans of Victoria Bitter and sat down at the empty table under the shade. The couples couldn’t help but say hello.</p>
<p>“I’m Tom, and this is my wife, Heather, and these are my children, Owen and Olivia,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“I’m Hans, and this is Petra,” Hans replied.</p>
<p>“We’re Americans. From Seattle,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“We are from Leiden in Holland,” Hans said. “I’m an engineer. From a very long line of engineers. Car engineers.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed. My great-grandfather invented the steering wheel.”</p>
<p>Owen raised his head from his homework. “Your actual grandfather, like, invented the steering wheel?” he asked, not believing it.</p>
<p>“My great-grandfather.”</p>
<p>“He told you that?” Owen asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I doubt it,” Owen said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>“So what do you do, Petra?” Heather asked the woman.</p>
<p>“I am a sociologist,” she replied.</p>
<p>Owen was still looking at Hans with deep doubt, typical of a twelve-year-old boy. It was starting to feel a little awkward. “I think it is too hot here. We will eat in the car,” Hans announced. The couple went back to the Volkswagen van.</p>
<p>“Owen, why did you give that guy a hard time?” Tom asked when they had gone.</p>
<p>“I didn’t give him a hard time. I totally believed him. After all, my great-great-grandmother invented the spoon. Before that, only forks,” Owen said.</p>
<p>“And our great-great-great-grandfather invented fire,” Olivia said.</p>
<p>Heather, Owen, and Olivia were all laughing now, and Tom started laughing too.</p>
<p>A Toyota Hilux stopped, and two men got out. The bigger of the two was wearing a type of cowboy hat, jeans, a red checked shirt, and boots. He was about thirty-five, with a neatly cut black beard, dark eyebrows, and blue eyes. Handsome, Tom supposed, if you liked the strong, outdoor type. The second man was slightly shorter, maybe around six feet. He was older, about fifty, losing his hair. He was thin and tall and looked a bit threatening. His left cheek had a scar, and there was an old tattoo on his neck that could possibly have been an anchor. He was wearing work clothes with rubber boots and no shirt underneath.</p>
<p>Tom looked at his watch. It was noon. “Well, everyone, time to head back,” he said.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen a koala!” Olivia complained.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen anything!” Owen added.</p>
<p>“We tried our best. But I have to get home to work,” Tom said.</p>
<p>Owen became completely upset: He was the worst dad ever. This trip was terrible. Why had they even bothered coming to Australia if they weren’t going to see anything? Olivia crossed her arms, shook her head, and looked very angry.</p>
<p>Tom looked at Heather, but she could not do anything about this.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, friends,” a voice said. It was the taller of the two men. “Couldn’t help hearing – you kids want to see a koala?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Olivia said.</p>
<p>“Follow me,” the man said.</p>
<p>The family followed him to the back of the Toyota, where, in a cage under a blanket, there was a sleeping koala.</p>
<p>“Oooh! Can we hold him?” Olivia asked.</p>
<p>“No, sorry, can’t do that,” the man said. “They’re very likely to get sick, and you’re Americans, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Yes, from Seattle,” Tom said. “I’m Tom, and this is Heather, Olivia, and Owen.”</p>
<p>“I’m Matt, and this failed experiment is my brother Jacko,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“Hey! Watch what you say!” Jacko said angrily.</p>
<p>“Where did this little guy come from?” Heather asked, pointing to the koala.</p>
<p>“We’re from across the bay there – a private island – and there are koalas everywhere. And wallabies, echidnas, wombats – it’s like a wild park, mate,” Jacko said.</p>
<p>The children turned to their dad. “We have to go!” Olivia said.</p>
<p>Tom shook his head. “Did you say private island?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sorry, no visitors,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“Dad!” Owen protested, and Olivia added a dramatic sigh of not believing.</p>
<p>Tom looked at them. They had had a very difficult year. And he had been so strict on this trip. Maybe a little bit of paying extra would work? “Is there a ferry? We’d be willing to pay,” Tom said.</p>
<p>Matt shook his head. “There is a ferry, but it’s not about the money. Mom doesn’t like visitors. Dutch Island is her place, you know?”</p>
<p>“How much money?” Jacko said.</p>
<p>Tom had taken out three hundred dollars at the Alice Springs airport, and he had received his conference daily allowance of seven hundred dollars. He had close to a thousand Australian dollars with him. He opened his wallet. “Four…five hundred dollars? Just to see, maybe take some photos? For the children,” he said.</p>
<p>“You Americans! You can’t buy everything, mate!” Matt said, shaking his head with disapproval. But Jacko put his arm around Matt and led him away for a minute. The two men had a very angry discussion. The Dutch couple had come out of their van to see what was happening.</p>
<p>“Dutch Island, did he say?” Hans asked.</p>
<p>“If you can pay nine hundred dollars, that will be three hundred each for me, Matt, and Ivan, who runs the ferry,” Jacko said. “But you’d have to be very quick. Just some quick photos and then leave again.”</p>
<p>“Nine hundred dollars! That’s crazy,” Tom protested. That was – what? Five hundred American?</p>
<p>“Dad!” Owen cried again.</p>
<p>“Maybe we should just go back to Melbourne,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“You’ll be missing out. It’s a very special place,” Jacko said. “Unique. Animals everywhere. We make our own electricity. Grow our own food. No phones. No taxes. No police. When was the last time we had a police officer out here, Matty?”</p>
<p>“Before my time,” Matt said. “But that’s not the—”</p>
<p>“Koalas, birds, even some penguins,” Jacko continued.</p>
<p>“Penguins, Dad!” Olivia said.</p>
<p>“Six hundred is my limit,” Tom insisted.</p>
<p>“If we can come too, we can add the difference,” Hans said.</p>
<p>Matt was shaking his head the whole time, but Jacko’s wide, unfriendly smile only got bigger. “I think we have a deal, then, friends.”</p>
