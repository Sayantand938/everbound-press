<p>The disc brakes were strong, but the Porsche was going too fast and had too much force.</p>
<p>“Oh, sweet Jesus!” Tom shouted as the Porsche hit the bicycle with a horrible sound. They scraped and slid along the ground for about twenty meters before sliding into a ditch beside the road. The airbags filled with air, and Heather was pushed back by her seat belt. The car stopped as the wheels spun and the engine turned off.</p>
<p>Heather opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The world was tilted at an angle. Tall white grass grew on both sides of the road. The woman and the bicycle were not there. The airbag was slowly going down in front of her.</p>
<p>Heather’s neck hurt, and she had dug her fingernails into her wrist. Her parents had taught her how to check herself for injuries. She checked herself for bleeding or broken bones, but she knew she was mostly OK. She unbuckled her seat belt and turned around to look at the children.</p>
<p>The side airbags in the back seat had filled with air and then gone down. Olivia was confused but seemed OK. Owen had cut his cheek on his seat belt.</p>
<p>“Are you OK, Owen?” she asked.</p>
<p>His eyes found hers and he nodded.</p>
<p>“Say it. Tell me if you’re OK or not.”</p>
<p>“I’m OK,” he said.</p>
<p>“Good. Olivia, are you OK?”</p>
<p>Olivia nodded. “I think so. What happened?”</p>
<p>“Did we hit something?” Owen asked.</p>
<p>Heather looked at Tom. His airbag was pushing him into his seat. His side of the car had gone into the ditch, and his body was leaning away from her.</p>
<p>“Tom? Tom! Are you hurt?” she asked.</p>
<p>“What? No…not…hurt. Head…window.” He groaned.</p>
<p>“Let me see.”</p>
<p>He had hit his head against the window and had a scrape on his forehead. He was clearly shocked, maybe had a concussion.</p>
<p>For the past six months, Tom had done everything for her. He opened doors, paid bills, argued with waiters, paid off her credit card debt, did almost all the driving, and certainly dealt with all the emergencies. But he would need a few minutes to get better, and the children couldn’t—</p>
<p>She would have to—</p>
<p>“I’ll get out,” she said. “Children, I want both of you to stay in the car for now. Both of you take off your seat belts. Olivia, help your brother.”</p>
<p>Heather’s shoulder hurt where the seat belt had hit her. She pushed the airbag, which had lost its air, to the side and found the handle to open the door. Her fingers felt strange, and her arm felt weak. She pushed the door, but nothing happened. She pushed harder, and still nothing. She kicked it hard, and it opened.</p>
<p>The heat hit her like a wave.</p>
<p>She had forgotten how hot it was. The air conditioning must have been working very well.</p>
<p>She got out of the car and fell onto the road. Her hands burned on the hot road surface.</p>
<p>Getting up, she took a breath and then walked with difficulty around to the front of the SUV. The woman was not there. For a moment, she felt a small hope. She looked through the grass on both sides of the road. It was easy to hope that Tom had somehow missed the woman, but Heather knew that wasn’t true. She had felt the crunch of the bike under the tires.</p>
<p>She got down on one knee and looked under the SUV. The bicycle was there, under the back left wheel. She quickly went back behind the car and saw the woman’s body, badly injured, about another ten feet down the road.</p>
<p>She ran and knelt beside her. “Are you…oh my God.”</p>
<p>Both of her legs were twisted under her in a way that legs should not be able to go. She was bleeding through her blue dress. Heather lifted the dress and saw a very large scrape across her chest, but no clear deep cut. She did not seem to be breathing.</p>
<p>“Oh my God, I am so sorry! Oh no, I am so, so sorry. You poor…we didn’t see…oh my God…”</p>
<p>Blood was coming slowly from her nose and mouth.</p>
<p>She needed a doctor. “Tom! Get out here!”</p>
<p>Heather put her hand on the woman’s neck and counted for ten seconds, but she could not feel a pulse. She gently moved the woman’s head back, put two fingers in her mouth, and cleared out blood, broken teeth, and a piece of skin.</p>
<p>“Come on, please…” Heather said and tried to give her air.</p>
<p>She tried to blow air into the woman’s lungs, but it came back into her own mouth. It was not like air that gives life; it was sharp, warm, old, and smelled strongly of blood. Something was blocking her airway. She lifted the body, which felt soft and without strength. “It’s going to be OK,” she said.</p>
<p>She hit the woman’s back, and another piece of skin fell from her lips.</p>
<p>“Tom! I need you! Get out here!”</p>
<p>Heather put her back on the ground and gave her mouth-to-mouth breathing. This time, the air seemed to go into what was left of the woman’s lungs.</p>
<p>Heather began doing chest compressions.</p>
<p>She did this twenty times and then checked for a pulse.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Blood was pouring from her ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.</p>
<p>Flies were beginning to land on her.</p>
<p>“Shit.” Heather knew she was only moving blood around a dead woman’s body. She was not going to be able to save her. Only doctors and nurses with special training and blood could—</p>
<p>She took her phone out of her jeans and dialed 911.</p>
<p>No, not 911. What was the number in Australia? 000.</p>
<p>She dialed 000. There was no phone signal. She held the phone up as high as she could. Still no signal.</p>
<p>She ran to the front of the car and climbed across the very hot hood, burning her hands as she climbed over it.</p>
<p>Tom was staring at her through the front window, confused. The children were starting to move behind him.</p>
<p>“Check on the children and get out here!” she said.</p>
<p>Tom looked at her, confused for a moment, and then nodded.</p>
<p>Heather looked at her phone. It said, “No service.”</p>
<p>The farm Matt had talked about couldn’t be too far away. Would they have a phone? Didn’t Matt say they didn’t have phones here, or was she remembering it wrong?</p>
<p>She jumped off the hood and ran back to the woman.</p>
<p>She tried pushing on her chest again.</p>
<p>She tried and tried.</p>
<p>A lot of blood poured from the woman’s mouth.</p>
<p>Heather stopped what she was doing.</p>
<p>The woman’s whole chest must be full of blood. A large blood vessel had probably burst. There was nothing she could do. No one could do anything. The crash had killed her, and she had surely been brain-dead for minutes already.</p>
<p>It had never been possible to save her.</p>
<p>Heather pulled the blue dress back down over the body. The woman had such a kind, lovely, gentle face. She was someone’s daughter, sister, wife. A young life ended by them.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. We didn’t see you. Oh God, I’m so sorry,” she said as tears filled her eyes.</p>
<p>Heather heard a noise behind her – Tom getting out of the car. He finally appeared next to her, covered with dirt. He must have climbed out the window on his side of the car and quickly moved to her along the ditch.</p>
<p>“Oh my God!” he said. “What have I done!”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t your fault. She came out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>“I honked the horn! Didn’t I? My God. She didn’t even look around!”</p>
<p>“There was nothing you could do, Tom.” She stood up and tried to take his hand, but he pushed her hand away.</p>
<p>“Is she dead? Are you sure?” Tom asked.</p>
<p>“She’s dead. She died right away.”</p>
<p>“CPR! I’m a trained…let me see…we can…shit, look at her!”</p>
<p>“I thought so too. But I’ve already tried that. It’s too late. Tom, look, there’s nothing you could have done. You braked as soon as—”</p>
<p>“If we had the new model. The one I asked for. The system that avoids accidents would have braked the car for us. That’s the one I wanted. I told you that!”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“It was you and the children. We weren’t supposed to come here! I wanted to work on my speech!”</p>
<p>Tom’s fists were tight. His eyes were wide and staring; he looked almost out of control.</p>
<p>He didn’t get like this often, but she had seen it once or twice. His anger had surprised her. She knew she had to make him calm down quickly.</p>
<p>He was taller than her by about six inches. She stood on her toes and reached up, put her hands behind his neck, and gently pushed his head down to look her in the eyes.</p>
<p>“Tom!” she said, clicking her fingers in front of his face.</p>
<p>“I had no idea there would be people on bicycles in this heat! Who rides a bicycle when it’s a hundred degrees? I was looking for koalas in the trees. They should have told us. Did you see any speed-limit signs? I didn’t see one.”</p>
<p>“There were no signs, Tom. She came out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>“I can save her! There’s always hope. I worked in the emergency room during my training!” Tom said and got down on his knees.</p>
<p>She knew he would not believe she was dead until he saw it himself.</p>
<p>She looked up and down the road. There were no cars. No one was coming.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>She looked at the Porsche. Both wheels were in the ditch, but it was a narrow channel, less than a foot wide and only two feet deep. They should be able to start moving again quite quickly. They would almost certainly have to push the car out, though. It was important to make it lighter. She would drive, and Tom would have to push. The children could help. Owen was strong, and Olivia, with her long legs, could help with the pushing force.</p>
<p>Tom had started CPR.</p>
<p>She let him try it for a minute.</p>
<p>“It’s not working,” he said.</p>
<p>“She’s dead, Tom.”</p>
<p>“I was driving too fast. That guy scared me. And I was looking out the window and driving too fast. We have to call the police. An ambulance,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s too late for all that now. There’s nothing anyone can do.”</p>
<p>Tom stood up and tried to get a signal on his phone.</p>
<p>Heather walked to the Porsche, opened the back door, and searched for the beach blanket. She took it and checked on the children, who were still trying to unbuckle their seat belts and deal with the airbags. She walked back to Tom and put the blanket over the woman.</p>
<p>Heather looked up and down the road again. Still empty.</p>
<p>She thought about the situation.</p>
<p>What she was thinking now was the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>Absolutely the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>Legally.</p>
<p>Morally.</p>
<p>It was a crime called a hit-and-run.</p>
<p>Tom had killed the woman. And now she was going to make this terrible act even worse. It felt clearly wrong. But all her feelings told her that this was the only choice.</p>
<p>She tried to think what her mother would tell her to do.</p>
<p>Her mother, she decided, would tell her to wait for the police.</p>
<p>Her father would tell her to get out of there quickly.</p>
<p>She went back to the Porsche and opened the back door. She leaned in and unbuckled Olivia’s seat belt.</p>
<p>“Are you OK, honey?” she asked.</p>
<p>Olivia nodded and then shook her head. “My arm hurts.”</p>
<p>“Let me see.”</p>
<p>The seat belt had scraped her arm. It wasn’t broken. “I’ll put a bandage on that in a minute. Let me help you out. Take your water bottle.”</p>
<p>She took Olivia’s hand and pulled her out of the car.</p>
<p>“Wait by the front of the car for a little while I get your brother.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“There’s been an accident. I want you to wait by the front of the car. I know it’s hot. Can you do that for me?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Olivia said, still confused.</p>
<p>Getting Owen out was more difficult. He was almost completely still and unresponsive. He had gone back behind his “wall,” which was something he had been doing since his mother’s death that Heather had never really understood.</p>
<p>“Olivia, you need to help me with Owen.”</p>
<p>“Owen! It’s me! Come on,” Olivia said, and together they helped him out.</p>
<p>Heather walked back to Tom. “I’ve got the children out of the car. You three can push, and I’ll drive us out of the ditch,” she said.</p>
<p>“At that farm, they might have a radio. We could call for a medical helicopter,” Tom suggested.</p>
<p>“No, Tom. The crash killed her, and you…we ran over her. Her lungs and inside organs are crushed. I know you know that. There’s nothing anyone can do now.”</p>
<p>Tom still looked confused, but he was nodding.</p>
<p>This was the moment.</p>
<p>Heather had to make the decision now. It was her choice, and she knew Tom would agree.</p>
<p>But what was the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Her sense of right and wrong and her feelings for survival were pulling her in completely opposite directions.</p>
<p>“Look, honey, you met those people,” she began. “It’s all one family on this island. They control the ferry, which is the only way we can leave. We have no phone service. We can’t get help. We completely depend on them.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“You heard what Jacko said about the police. He told me they chased someone off the island with guns. It sounds like they make their own rules here.”</p>
<p>“What—what are you suggesting?” Tom asked.</p>
<p>Heather looked at him. Tom was older, yes; he had read more, yes; but he spent time with only a few types of people. He came from a rich family, and his understanding of people was surprisingly small. One night sleeping outside in the Tacoma bus station would have taught him more than reading a thousand books.</p>
<p>“We hide her in the long grass with her bike. We get the car out of the ditch, drive to the ferry, and leave this island as soon as possible. When we are safely back on the mainland, we can tell the police that we might have hit something when we were driving. We thought it was an animal, but we are not sure.”</p>
<p>“You want us – me – to leave the place where the accident happened? An accident we caused?”</p>
<p>She looked into his eyes. His pupils were large. His hands were shaking. His mind was somewhere else again.</p>
<p>“What’s h-happened?” Olivia asked. She was too curious and had come to see what was happening. Owen was ten feet behind her. “Is that blood?”</p>
<p>Heather turned. “Go back to the front of the car, please, Olivia. Take your brother.”</p>
<p>“Is someone dead?” Olivia said, with her hand over her mouth. She was pale, shaking, and scared.</p>
<p>“Yes, someone’s dead,” Tom said quietly.</p>
<p>Heather showed she was in pain, took Olivia’s hand, took Owen by the arm, and led them to the front of the Porsche.</p>
<p>“There’s been an accident. You two will have to be brave, OK?” she said softly.</p>
<p>She noticed there was blood and a dent on the Porsche’s air intake. They would have to clean that before they returned it to the car dealer. The large metal bumper at the front of the car was also dented; not badly, but it would still need to be explained.</p>
<p>Owen pulled his hand away. “Dad killed her, didn’t he? He killed her,” he said in a strange, far-away voice, as if from the bottom of a deep hole. Owen, like Olivia, seemed older and younger than his age at the same time. He was twelve, sometimes acting like he was fifteen, sometimes like a scared little boy.</p>
<p>Heather walked back to Tom.</p>
<p>“How are the children?” he asked.</p>
<p>“The children are going to be OK. Look, you did your best. You braked. You honked the horn.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Tom said loudly. “Yes, I honked the horn. And this wasn’t the car that I wanted. I wanted the other one.”</p>
<p>“You did everything you could. This wasn’t our fault. I think we should go now. I think we should get in the car and get to the ferry as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Tom nodded.</p>
<p>“We’ll move the body off the road and drive to the ferry,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“We really shouldn’t do that. It’s a crime,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we have a choice. They are scary people. They have guns. It’s all one family. Do you trust them to call the police?”</p>
<p>He thought about it. “I can see what you are…but this is a very big decision,” Tom said. She noticed that sweat was running down his face. And the scrape on his forehead was bleeding.</p>
<p>“You know what? It’s my fault, Tom. I’m making the decision,” Heather said. “You hit your head. This is my choice, OK? You don’t have to think about any of this right now. All you have to do is help me move the body off the road. We’re going to put her in that long grass over there.”</p>
<p>“You want us to actually move her?”</p>
<p>“We have to. You are going to take her by the ankles, and we are going to put her in the grass. OK?”</p>
<p>Tom got down on his knees and bent the woman’s legs back. They made a horrible cracking noise that made him feel cold. Tom lifted the woman’s ankles, and Heather picked her up by the shoulders. Sticky warm blood came slowly between her fingers. And now a lot of flies were starting to gather. They landed on Heather’s hands and arms and on the dead woman’s face.</p>
<p>“Are you sure about this?” Tom asked. “You should never move a body. I remember when I found Judith…on those stairs…I didn’t want the children to think she had done it on purpose. I wanted to change things. Hide the glass, hide the whiskey bottle. But I had to leave everything the way I found it…we shouldn’t be doing this.”</p>
<p>“We’ve already moved her. It’s too late now. Just go back a few steps. It’s easy. Please, Tom, do it now, I can’t hold her forever! Go!”</p>
<p>Tom began walking backward toward the open land.</p>
<p>“That’s it, over the ditch and into the grass.”</p>
<p>Getting over the ditch was difficult, but they managed it. They put the woman down in the long, white dry grass. “Now the bike,” Heather said.</p>
<p>They pulled the front wheel of the bike from under the back tire of the Porsche. They carried the broken bike into the grass and hid it too. Heather moved some of the tall grass stems, making them stand up again to hide the path they had made.</p>
<p>She ran back to the road and threw the larger pieces of the bicycle into the grass. There was blood and smaller bike parts, but they couldn’t do anything about that. Heather closed her eyes for a few seconds and then opened them and tried to find where they had hidden the body in the open land. You couldn’t see anything. Especially from a moving car.</p>
<p>She wiped the blood from her hands onto the blanket as well as she could. She wiped Tom’s hands and forehead. Their fingernails were very dirty, and they smelled terrible. Blackflies and mosquitoes were landing on them freely.</p>
<p>“OK, now we just have to get out of here,” Heather said as calmly as she could while putting the blanket back in the trunk of the Porsche. “Children, I need you to help your dad push the car out of the ditch,” she said, leading them to the back of the car.</p>
<p>“What happened to that lady?” Olivia said.</p>
<p>“We are moving her out of the sun, and then we are going to call the police,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“Do you know what you are doing, Heather?” Olivia asked. “Shouldn’t we get an ambulance or something?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we’ll get an ambulance later, Olivia,” Heather said. “We just need to get the car moving. Tom, please come here and show the children what to do. I’ll drive.”</p>
<p>“I should drive,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“No, I’m lighter than you, and you are stronger than me. You push, and I’ll drive.”</p>
<p>“That makes sense,” he said.</p>
<p>Heather walked along the ditch and got into the driver’s seat. She adjusted the mirror and saw her own face for a moment.</p>
<p>Where had this Heather come from? Had this Heather been hiding there the whole time? Was it just because Tom had a concussion and she had to take charge, or was this always part of her? Adrenaline helped. When that feeling went away, she would probably feel terrible.</p>
<p>She turned on the traction control and switched to low gear. Her old Honda had a manual gearbox, and she was comfortable using the clutch and gear stick. This wouldn’t be difficult. She pressed the start button, and the Porsche started.</p>
<p>“Everyone ready?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“Push!” she shouted and pressed the gas pedal.</p>
<p>The wheels spun in the ditch, and the car did not move.</p>
<p>“Did you switch on the traction control?” Tom shouted.</p>
<p>“Yes! Keep pushing,” Heather replied.</p>
<p>They pushed hard, and the front wheel slowly started to move out of the ditch. She kept the steering wheel straight, and very slowly the heavy car climbed out onto the road.</p>
<p>They were across the road from any cars coming. “Get in! Get the children in!” Heather said. Tom quickly got into the front passenger seat. The children got in the back.</p>
<p>Now all she had to do was turn the—</p>
<p>She saw something.</p>
<p>Another car was coming. A Toyota. One of the cars from the farm. She was never going to be able to turn in time. Shit. If they had had another thirty seconds, no one would have known…</p>
<p>She turned the Porsche onto the left side of the road, and the Toyota stopped next to them. A window was rolled down. It was Jacko and Matt.</p>
<p>“Hi,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“What happened to you all?” Matt asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Just turning,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“Did you go in the sheugh?” Jacko asked.</p>
<p>“The what?”</p>
<p>“Ma calls it the sheugh. That ditch. Did you go in it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but we are OK now,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“Your airbags went off,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“They did,” Heather said. “The car is so sensitive – we weren’t even going fast…Anyway, we are fine, thank you for stopping. We should go if we are going to catch the ferry,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“Is your husband OK? Are you OK, mate? You look terrible. Did you hit your head?” Matt asked.</p>
<p>“I am fine,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“What about the children?”</p>
<p>“They are fine. Everyone is fine. We just need to go get that ferry.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you should go,” Matt agreed.</p>
<p>“We will. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t see Ellen by any chance? A girl on a bike?” Jacko asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Tom said quickly.</p>
<p>“We didn’t see anyone,” Heather added. “Well, I guess we should go. Bye.”</p>
<p>She rolled the window up, waved, and began driving down the road.</p>
<p>In the mirror, she saw Jacko and Matt sit in the car for a moment before Matt opened the door and got out.</p>
<p>She saw him get down on one knee and start looking at the ground before she could no longer see him at the bend in the road.</p>
<p>“Shit,” Heather said quietly and pressed the gas pedal hard. “Seat belts, everyone!” she called and drove the Porsche at seventy miles an hour toward the ferry port.</p>
<p>They reached the ferry terminal in two minutes, and luckily the ferry was there.</p>
<p>She slowed the Porsche and put on a smile.</p>
<p>“No one say anything, OK?” she said, looking at Tom and then turning around to the children. “No one say anything. We’ll deal with this when we are over the water.”</p>
<p>She waved to Ivan, stopped the car, and rolled the window down as he came over.</p>
<p>“Hi there!” she said.</p>
<p>“Did you see a koala or two?” Ivan asked, leaning into the car window. It was then that Heather noticed he had a black and yellow object attached to his work clothes. It was a walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” Heather said to make him feel sure.</p>
<p>Ivan picked his nose and sighed. “So you are going to drive onto the ferry? Not your husband?”</p>
<p>“I’ll drive. He is a bit tired.”</p>
<p>“You know, I can do it if you want. Never driven a Porsche before,” Ivan said.</p>
<p>Heather took a quick look at the blood all over the steering wheel. “No, I’m happy driving it on if you will guide me,” she said with a friendly smile.</p>
<p>“Of course I’ll guide you, missy. No worries. Did you have a small accident? I see the airbags went off.”</p>
<p>“Not really – we just went into a ditch. The airbags are so sensitive. The person we rented the car from warned us about it,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“Modern cars! I drove my old Holden Sandman for thirty years and never had a problem. Did the children get pictures near the koalas?”</p>
<p>“Um, yes,” Heather said, hoping Ivan would not ask to see them.</p>
<p>“Evil little animals. They can give you a bad scratch. The koalas, I mean, not your children! All right, I’ll put the ramp down, and you just drive on slowly. Stop completely and put your hand brake on. What you Americans call the emergency brake. It’s right next to your seat.”</p>
<p>Ivan lowered the ramp and she drove onto the ferry.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Ivan said.</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>Heather turned the engine off. Ivan put his hands into his pockets and took out a pack of cigarettes. He lit one.</p>
<p>He did not seem to be in any particular hurry to get going.</p>
<p>“Um, look, could we go over now?” Heather asked.</p>
<p>Ivan shook his head. “I would prefer to wait. That Dutch couple should be here any minute. I told them to be quick.”</p>
<p>“Matt said you would take us over now,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“Matt? He sometimes acts like he is more important than he is. He is not even an O’Neill. He is a Watson. This is my ferry, and I decide when we go.”</p>
<p>“We are sort of rushing to get back to Melbourne. We have a dinner reservation.”</p>
<p>Ivan made a low sound and put his hands in his pockets. “I would have to make two trips…”</p>
<p>Heather reached into her jeans pocket, took out a fifty-dollar bill, and checked it to make sure there was no blood on it.</p>
<p>“That would be a big problem for you. Maybe if I paid you extra?” she asked, holding the bill out the window.</p>
<p>Ivan smiled widely and quickly took it. “Let’s get going.”</p>
<p>He raised the ramp and closed the gate at the back of the ferry.</p>
<p>Heather looked behind her to see if she could see any other cars coming down the road.</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<p>Ivan untied the ropes that attached the ferry to the shore and jumped back onto the boat. He started the diesel engine.</p>
<p>“Should we tell him about the woman?” Olivia asked.</p>
<p>“No one says anything until we are on the other side,” Heather said in a low, angry voice.</p>
<p>“Mainland Australia, here we come!” Ivan said loudly. “You can get out of the car if you want.”</p>
<p>“We are OK,” Heather replied.</p>
<p>White water appeared behind the ferry, and Dutch Island slowly began to move away into the distance.</p>
<p>Heather found that she had been holding her breath.</p>
<p>Ivan walked up to the car window.</p>
<p>“Did anyone tell you about the foxes? Kate and I have been catching the little animals. They are a type of animal that is not from here and causes problems. Kate has a large collection of skulls. The government pays us for them.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t see any foxes,” Heather said, putting her hand over the blood on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>“All right. Well, look, if I see any sharks, I will let you know, and you can take a picture,” Ivan said and went back to the steering handle.</p>
<p>“I think we—” Tom began and stopped as Ivan quickly took the walkie-talkie off his jacket.</p>
<p>“What?” Ivan was saying. “I can’t hear you. I can’t hear you.”</p>
<p>He made the diesel engine run slowly. He hit the walkie-talkie and played with its dial. “I can’t hear you, mate,” he said.</p>
<p>Heather’s knuckles were white as she held the Porsche’s steering wheel tightly. Sweat made the back of her T-shirt wet. She knew she looked terrible. Like someone guilty in a police lineup.</p>
<p>“Maybe we should—” Tom began.</p>
<p>“No,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“I think I got you, mate!” Ivan said. “Speak up.”</p>
<p>Ivan walked to the back of the ferry and had a conversation on the walkie-talkie that Heather could not hear.</p>
<p>She did not like this at all. She took out her phone and quickly typed Help to Carolyn, the last person she had texted.</p>
<p>Unable to send. No phone signal, the message said.</p>
<p>Ivan clipped the radio back onto his jacket.</p>
<p>He picked up a sports bag, opened it, and took out something.</p>
<p>Heather leaned over the steering wheel to see what it was.</p>
<p>“What is he doing?” Olivia asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Ivan walked slowly back to the driver’s window. He pointed an old-looking gun at Heather’s face. “Give me all your phones, and then get out of the car slowly and carefully. If you try anything clever, anything at all, I will shoot one of the children. Do you understand me?”</p>
