<p>The Toyota Hilux was waiting for them at the Dutch Island dock. A strong blond woman with a pump-action shotgun quickly put them in the back.</p>
<p>They learned this was Kate, the youngest of Ma’s children.</p>
<p>“No talking,” Kate said.</p>
<p>The road from the ferry to the farm was empty and sad. There was open heathland with about a dozen old, burned-out cars left to rust. The farm itself was a mix of barns, sheds, weak-looking houses like those in Buster Keaton films, two smaller homes, and a large farmhouse facing a yard. The buildings had metal roofs that were in poor condition. Children in dusty work clothes watched the car arrive.</p>
<p>They were made to walk into the farmhouse.</p>
<p>The kids, Heather saw, were getting tired quickly. Olivia was wearing her jeans and a Grimes T-shirt. Owen had on heavy green cargo shorts with his usual red hoodie and Adidas sneakers. Heather had put on DL 1961 jeans and a black T-shirt. Tom wore thick chinos and a white long-sleeved button-down oxford shirt. All of these clothes were right for the heat in Washington State but not for the heat in Australia.</p>
<p>“Over here!” Kate said and made them sit on a sofa.</p>
<p>The room started to fill with people.</p>
<p>Matt, Ivan, Jacko, and another brother, Brian, squeezed onto a sofa opposite them. Matt had taken off his cowboy hat. He, Jacko, and Brian all had rifles. Kate stood by the window with her shotgun. No one was speaking. It was a large room that felt smaller because of all the old furniture and small objects collected over many years. There was a fireplace with a fire burning in it, even in this heat. On a shelf above the fireplace were dozens of family photos; more were on the wall with old yellow wallpaper that was peeling in the corners. Pictures of the farm in better times. Pictures of Ireland. Postcards from Sydney and London. Years of hot summers had cracked the floorboards and filled the cracks with dead insects and dirt. The sofas were leather, fixed with tape, and covered with blankets. It seemed the whole O’Neill family had come in here to stare at them. Men and women with guns. Kids who had been laughing were now quiet. A dog sitting between Matt’s legs looked nervously up the stairs.</p>
<p>An old clock was ticking incredibly slowly.</p>
<p>No one seemed to know what would happen next.</p>
<p>The temperature was too hot to bear.</p>
<p>Heather was holding Tom’s hand on one side and Olivia’s hand on the other. Usually, Olivia didn’t let Heather touch her. At least Tom seemed a little better. He had lost that terrible pale look, and his eyes were back to normal.</p>
<p>“What time does Danny get back?” Jacko asked Matt in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>“Won’t be back until after six,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“Right…” Jacko said.</p>
<p>The stairs made a creaking sound.</p>
<p>Creaked again.</p>
<p>Everyone looked up.</p>
<p>Heather saw a pair of feet at the top of the stairs. The feet took a step down and became ankles and then calves. A strong woman in pink slippers and a pink dress was coming down the stairs, helped by a stick on one side and a little girl on the other. She was in her seventies, pale, with an eye patch over her left eye. She was wearing a bright copper-colored wig. There was something frightening about her that wasn’t just about how she looked. Heather had massaged many older clients, many of whom were physically large or strong. This was different. This woman changed the feeling of the room. She made it feel tense and electric. Heather could tell that everyone in the room was afraid of her, and that made Heather afraid of her too.</p>
<p>She came down the stairs slowly.</p>
<p>Very slowly.</p>
<p>Two kids quickly got up from a rocking chair near the fire. Matt turned the chair to face the room, not the fireplace. When she reached the bottom of the stairs, the woman breathed heavily and then continued to move across the living room like an old leader arriving for a questioning.</p>
<p>Matt helped the woman into the rocking chair, and when he sat down again, the dog hid under his legs.</p>
<p>A sound like a broken lawnmower engine came from the woman’s mouth, and a child brought her a glass of clear liquid that she drank quickly with satisfaction.</p>
<p>This, clearly, was Ma.</p>
<p>“They’re the Americans?” Ma said in a rough voice that seemed to come from near death.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Americans,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“I’ve known a few Americans. Terry said they were okay in Vietnam. The ones I met were okay. What does he do for a living?” Ma asked.</p>
<p>“He’s a doctor. Dr. Thomas Baxter. He looks after people’s knees. He has ID. It checks out,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“How much money in the wallet?”</p>
<p>“Four hundred bucks.”</p>
<p>“And how much did you bad people get already?” Ma said.</p>
<p>“Nine hundred,” Matt replied, looking a bit ashamed.</p>
<p>“That’s not much. Not much for a life. What does she do?”</p>
<p>“Massage therapist, she says,” Jacko said.</p>
<p>“Jesus. One step up from a prostitute,” Ma said. “When does Danny get back?”</p>
<p>“Not until after six, maybe seven,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“Who else did you terrible people let onto my island today?” Ma said, looking angrily at Ivan.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t my fault, Ma. Jacko and Matt—” Ivan started to argue.</p>
<p>“Enough! I’m surprised at you, Matthew,” Ma said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Ma.”</p>
<p>“You let another vehicle on, didn’t you?” Ma said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Ma, a couple of Germans,” Ivan said.</p>
<p>“And where are they now?”</p>
<p>“Probably waiting at the ferry,” Ivan said.</p>
<p>“Well, someone go find them and bring them here!” Ma said in a low, angry voice.</p>
<p>Jacko nodded at a kid, who ran outside.</p>
<p>“Look, I’m very sorry about this,” Tom said. “She came right out of nowhere. I blew the horn and the woman didn’t hear me—”</p>
<p>“She’s deaf!” one of the children said.</p>
<p>“Deaf?” Tom said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Ellen was deaf,” Ma said.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t help it. I hit the back of her car. It all happened so fast. I mean, of course we will work fully with the police.”</p>
<p>“What will you do, Dr. Baxter?” Jacko asked, making fun of Tom’s title.</p>
<p>“It’s, um, Tom. Um, look, I’ll take full responsibility. And—and I’m sure my insurance company will pay what is needed,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“Insurance companies don’t always pay, do they?” Ma said.</p>
<p>“They will. I’m admitting I was at fault.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going to admit you were at fault?” Ma asked.</p>
<p>“Here, and of course back in Melbourne. I’ll make sure I work fully with the police investigation and even delay our flight back if needed.”</p>
<p>“Nah,” Ma said. “No Melbourne. No flight back.”</p>
<p>People in the room whispered and then were silent again.</p>
<p>The sad ticking clock. The fire making crackling sounds. Mosquitoes buzzing. The dog whining. At the back of the room, Heather saw the man who had sold them the sausages. When the Dutch couple were brought in, everyone who knew about them coming here would be in this house under Ma’s control.</p>
<p>“You tried to hide the body. You hit someone with your car and drove away. That’s a crime. That’s a crime on Dutch Island and in Victoria and in America,” Ma said.</p>
<p>“That, um, that was my fault. Tom had hit his head. That was my idea,” Heather said. “I don’t know what I was thinking. I was scared. I wanted us to get to the mainland first before we called the police.”</p>
<p>“Scared. Yes,” Ma said. “We don’t want anyone to be scared, do we?” Ma shook her head and closed her eye. She seemed to be thinking carefully. A log in the fire cracked and split.</p>
<p>“Look, uh, maybe Ivan and I should take the ferry over to Stamford Bridge and call the police, let them handle it—what do you think, Ma?” Matt asked.</p>
<p>Heather looked at him and silently mouthed, Thank you.</p>
<p>Ivan and Jacko shook their heads.</p>
<p>“Too much history with the police in Victoria. You know what will happen,” Jacko said quietly. “One of us will get blamed for it and for other things, like making our own alcohol or something, and this person will get away completely free.”</p>
<p>Most of the adults in the room quietly agreed.</p>
<p>“Nah, no police. Terry never needed any police,” Ma said.</p>
<p>A long silence. Kids whispering. Sweat running down Heather’s back. It must have been 115 degrees in here. Even the big blackflies looked defeated and slow.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I could agree to pay some money now. As, um, proof that I am serious and that I am responsible,” Tom suggested.</p>
<p>Heather gave his hand a little squeeze. This might be the right way to handle it.</p>
<p>Ma coughed and someone got her another drink.</p>
<p>Tom stood up. “Look, I’m very sorry, I understand your—”</p>
<p>“Who said he could stand up? Make him sit down, Ivan!”</p>
<p>Ivan hit Tom in the stomach with the end of his rifle.</p>
<p>“Jesus! Not with the gun, mate!” Matt said with a pained sound, but it was too late; Tom was bent over on the floor.</p>
<p>Heather found herself getting up and rushing at Ivan. He slapped her hard on the face. Harder than she had ever been hit. She turned almost completely around and fell down too.</p>
<p>The children screamed. The dog started to bark.</p>
<p>“Christ, Matt, I can’t think with all this noise. Why did you bring them in here? Get them out of my house while I decide what we are going to do!” Ma said.</p>
<p>Heather felt sick from panic.</p>
<p>No one knew they had come here. Their phones were gone. The people organizing the conference wouldn’t start to worry about Tom until Monday night or even Tuesday morning before his main speech. And by then it would be too late.</p>
