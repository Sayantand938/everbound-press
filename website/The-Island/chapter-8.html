<p>Matt took Kate's arm and led her away from the shearing shed.</p>
<p>She shook him off. “What?” she asked sharply.</p>
<p>“We can’t do this. We can’t keep these people. One of us needs to go to the mainland and get the police,” Matt said.</p>
<p>Kate took a step away from him.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? Do you want me to tell Jacko you just said that? Or Ivan? Or Ma?”</p>
<p>“We have to think about the future, Kate. You know the trust fund is running out. How long can we keep this going? Two more years? Three?”</p>
<p>“What’s your point?”</p>
<p>“That eco-lodge idea Terry had. It's a good idea. Tourists coming over legally. Staying the night, spending money. We all benefit. But if we do this, it’s all over, isn’t it? Forget it.”</p>
<p>“Terry’s dead.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but the idea isn’t. You agreed with it. You, me, Janey, maybe some of the others. We talk to Ma before Ivan and Jacko and the others make her angry.”</p>
<p>Kate was shaking her head. “Ma thinks you’re the golden boy, Matt. She trusts you.”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of Ma. I’m thinking about what’s best for all of us. You want Jacko to run this? When he's half drunk? Jacko?”</p>
<p>“They came over here. They killed Ellen. They’ll get what they deserve!” Kate insisted.</p>
<p>“This is going to end with more people dying. Ivan told me what happened to that girl Jacko met in the early 2000s. Jesus! It doesn’t have to be that way. We can talk to Ma, you and me! Our whole future is at risk here. Look, when the trust is finished and the money is gone, what will we have to rely on? Nothing. The eco-lodge, tourism—that kind of thing could save us.”</p>
<p>“I don't like this kind of talk, Matt. We’re family—we’re united,” Kate said.</p>
<p>“Of course we are. But we have to do what’s best for the family in the long run. Not just tonight.”</p>
<p>Kate thought about it, then shook her head and slowly raised her shotgun. It stopped pointing at Matt’s chest. “You have to make a decision, Matty,” she said. “Are you from over there or are you from here? Are you one of them or one of us? Which is it?”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t,” Matt said, staring at the shiny double barrels of her shotgun. A gun that had killed hundreds of rabbits, cats, foxes, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>“Them or us, Matthew?”</p>
<p>Matt took off his hat and shook his head. The hatband was wet with sweat. He wiped his forehead and nodded. “Ma took me in. Treated me like a son. It’s always going to be family first.”</p>
<p>Kate lowered the gun. “That’s what I needed to hear, Matt. Jacko and Ivan never need to know we had this conversation. But I’ll be watching you. Just remember where your loyalties lie.”</p>
