      <h2 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h2>
<p>The kids were crying. Heather was trying to breathe. Many flies were circling slowly around him. Tom’s head was pounding. They had done this all wrong. If they had been honest from the start, perhaps the O’Neills wouldn’t have reacted so angrily. He should have followed his first instincts: Told them everything. Gotten the police involved. Why had he listened to Heather? She was young. She didn’t know anything.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>It was too late for blaming each other.</p>
<p>This didn’t necessarily have to be a deadly mistake. This wasn’t some rural area in America. This wasn’t a developing country. This was Australia, one of the most civilized countries on Earth. They would threaten and try to bully them, but a deal would be made. This exact situation had happened to Thomas Edison in Germany. Edison had hit a local woman with his car and he had simply opened his wallet and paid off the entire—</p>
<p>“What’s going to happen to us?” Olivia asked quietly.</p>
<p>“Nothing’s going to happen, sweetie. They’re just trying to scare us. That’s what bullies do,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“You killed the woman,” Owen said.</p>
<p>“It was an accident, Owen. I didn’t kill her. She suddenly turned onto the road with her bike. It was an accident. It’s the kind of sad thing that happens all the time.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lie. You are both liars. That’s not what happened,” Owen said, leaning forward but stopping suddenly as the ropes choked him.</p>
<p>Tom looked at Heather for support, but she was twisting around in her jeans trying to get comfortable or doing something he didn't understand.</p>
<p>“This is your fault, Heather,” Olivia cried. “We should have called the police. You don’t run away when you have an accident! Didn’t you ever learn that where you came from?”</p>
<p>“There was no phone signal,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“Now they’re going to get revenge on us,” Olivia said.</p>
<p>“That’s not how things work. Not in Australia. Not anywhere. They’re angry now, but they’ll be reasonable. This is a police matter. Sooner or later they’ll call the police,” Tom insisted.</p>
<p>“They said there aren’t any phones here either,” Owen said.</p>
<p>“They’ll take the ferry over to the mainland and call from there.” Tom could see Heather still moving around in the dirt. “What are you doing over there?” he asked.</p>
<p>Heather was drenched with sweat. She looked up at him. “I pushed my key chain down the front of my jeans. I think I can get it out.”</p>
<p>“What good will that do?”</p>
<p>“There’s a small knife on it,” Heather whispered. “I bought it in Alice Springs. I thought they’d make us empty our pockets, so I hid it.”</p>
<p>“Wow! You’re amazing.”</p>
<p>“Amazing if I can get it out,” she said as she tried to move the small knife down her pant leg.</p>
<p>Tom’s senses became sharper. Here was a plan B starting. He looked through the gaps in the wooden walls. It was dark. Probably the O’Neills would discuss what to do overnight, and in the morning they’d likely be more reasonable. But why take that risk? If they could cut their ropes, it wouldn’t be difficult to dig under the dirt at the back of the hut. It was, what, two miles across the land to the ferry? If the boat was still there and he could get its diesel engine working, they’d be across the small channel to the mainland in fifteen minutes. They were in a partly closed bay—surely the currents would take them to the shore. If he couldn’t get the diesel engine working, they could maybe launch it anyway and float over on the tide.</p>
<p>Heather had now moved the small knife down her leg and out the bottom of her jeans. She grabbed it in her tied hands and opened the blade. It was a tiny little thing.</p>
<p>“Is it sharp?” Tom asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Heather said, testing it with her thumb. “Shall I try to throw it to you?”</p>
<p>“No! Don’t do that. It might land in the middle between us, and then where would we be? Cut yourself free first and then bring it over,” Tom said in a loud whisper.</p>
<p>Heather began sawing at the ropes on her hands.</p>
<p>“Is it working?” Tom asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I think so, yes,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“I can’t breathe, Dad,” Olivia complained.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, honey. Try to put a finger between the ropes and your neck,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“OK,” Olivia replied, as if this were somehow a normal question and answer.</p>
<p>“What will we do if we can cut the ropes?” Owen asked.</p>
<p>“We’ll get ourselves free and then dig under the planks at the back of the shed. We’ll run into the bushes. The ferry dock is only two miles away across the land. We can easily get there,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“And then what?” Owen asked.</p>
<p>“We’ll take it to the other side.”</p>
<p>“What if the ferry is tied up on the other side of the channel?” Owen said.</p>
<p>Tom flinched. He hadn’t thought of that. “We’ll hide on the island.”</p>
<p>“They’ll find us,” Olivia cried softly.</p>
<p>Tom shook his head. “No, they won’t find us.”</p>
<p>Tom could see that Heather held the small knife between the thumb and forefinger of her right hand. The rope was very thick and she looked so awkward trying to cut it. “Is it definitely working?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I think so,” she said.</p>
<p>“Good, keep at it.”</p>
<p>“Can you really do this, Tom?” Heather asked him. “Hide us from them?”</p>
<p>“Of course I can,” he told her confidently.</p>
<p>Owen was getting excited now. “We could catch rabbits. We could make spears and hunt them.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly, Owen,” Olivia said.</p>
<p>“Did you tell anyone about us coming here?” Heather asked.</p>
<p>“No, but the GPS on our phones was working through most of the peninsula, so the police will be able to track where we went.”</p>
<p>“They won’t know we’ve come over here, though. The GPS wasn’t working on the ferry,” Heather said.</p>
<p>Tom didn’t need her negative attitude now, and she had that young person’s habit of saying everything she thought. “Honey!” he said gently. “The police will figure it out, won’t they?”</p>
<p>Heather understood what he meant. “Yes, yes, you’re right, of course. The police will be looking for us by now and they’ll find us tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Tom nodded. If they stayed calm, looked around, and focused on the present, it would be OK.</p>
<p>“That’s right. All three of you have to trust—”</p>
<p>Voices, people moving toward them…</p>
<p>“Oh no, they’re coming back, hide the knife in the dirt,” Tom said.</p>
<p>Heather quickly pushed the small knife into the floor as best she could just as the shed door opened.</p>
<p>“We need to talk to both of you again,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“We need water for the children,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“I’ll get you water. We decided we should talk to you and your wife before Danny gets here,” Matt said and began untying the rope that tied Heather’s neck to the wooden frame. Tom felt worried for a moment as Matt looked at the floor near where Heather was sitting, but he didn’t see the small knife. Matt untied the rope around Tom’s neck and pulled them both to their feet.</p>
<p>“This is completely wrong. You should be ashamed of yourself. You can’t keep us like this. These are little kids! What are you thinking?” Heather said to Matt.</p>
<p>Even in the dim light of the hut, Tom could see that Matt was embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Look, yes, I’m sorry about all this. But I did tell you not to come here,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“If you insist on keeping me and Tom so we can arrange some payment, then so be it,” Heather said. “But you need to take the children to the mainland on the ferry.”</p>
<p>Tom gave her a look that said 'I can handle this'. He wanted to make the situation less tense. Heather was getting upset. There was no way Ma would ever allow such a thing. “No, we don’t need you to do that. But our kids need water,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“I’ll bring them water. Come on,” he said. “Danny’s on the ferry. He’s almost here.”</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving these children in here by themselves,” Heather said.</p>
<p>“I promise you nothing’s going to happen to them. Trust me,” Matt said. He said it so sincerely that Tom believed him, and Heather found herself nodding.</p>
<p>“Come on, Heather,” Tom said. “Let’s be calm and we’ll go fix this.”</p>
<p>Kate was waiting outside the shearing shed with her shotgun. “She’s in the farmyard,” she said to Matt. “We brought Ma’s chair out.”</p>
<p>They walked slowly between the farm buildings and strange pieces of machinery that looked like threatening modern art.</p>
<p>They reached the farmyard, where the Porsche was still parked, and Tom noticed the Dutch couple’s camper van. Where were they in all this?</p>
<p>Ma was sitting in her rocking chair with about fifteen or twenty people gathered around her in the dim light. The flies had not scattered when the sun set, and there was a smell of rotting seaweed blowing in from the sea. Most of the adults had weapons, Tom noticed. Heather had better not try anything foolish.</p>
<p>“Danny’s coming. We should settle this now,” Ma said. “You two stand in front of me. We’re going to sort this out like grown-ups. Honestly and shake on it. Agreed?”</p>
<p>Tom nodded. “Of course. Once again, I am so sorry about Ellen. I apologize deeply on behalf of myself and my family.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Ma said. “You’ll have to apologize to Danny too. Make it a really good one. He loved that girl.”</p>
<p>“I will. Yes. And, look, before Danny gets here, maybe we could reach an agreement and present it to him as a done deal,” Tom suggested. “A done deal is a—”</p>
<p>“I know what it is!” Ma said. “I went to Mount Lourdes Grammar, didn’t I? Let’s see if we can get this sorted.”</p>
<p>Tom began to relax. Yes, Ma looked terrifying, but this showed a willingness to compromise. The word sorted was a good sign. Also, there was a strong hint of Ireland in Ma’s voice. She must have come over here as a little girl. The female leader of Dutch Island was not the descendant of some isolated group who worshipped false gods. She was just another immigrant trying to succeed in a big country.</p>
<p>Tom gave Heather a reassuring smile. He walked closer to Ma, head bowed, hands tied in front of him like a defeated enemy. “Obviously, what happened here is a terrible tragedy. It was my fault and I’m sorry, and I feel great sympathy for Ellen’s family and Danny.”</p>
<p>“Danny will be devastated,” a man said from the crowd. There was a general quiet agreement.</p>
<p>Tom bit his lip. Yes, the entire island was one large family, but Ma was in charge. Her word would be law. All he had to do was persuade her.</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry about the accident, but there was nothing bad intended. It was no one’s fault. It was just one of those things that happen,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“You were going too fast on that road,” Kate said, and again there was complaining from the crowd.</p>
<p>Tom knew a strong argument would be deadly to his plan. He just had to agree and appear sorry. “Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps we were going too fast,” he continued. “I did try to save her. I tried hard. I’m a doctor and I did my best. And afterward, when we saw it was no use, we just panicked. We did completely the wrong thing. Look, there’s no way we can bring back Ellen. But we can offer you, um, payment.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean money?” Jacko asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You’re a doctor. How much do you earn? My niece Maya is a nurse and she gets paid very little,” Ma said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing well lately. I was listed in Seattle’s Best Doctors this year and, um, well, to be honest, I married into quite a bit of money,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“How much money?” Kate asked.</p>
<p>“My late wife, Judith, came from a wealthy Seattle family. Have you heard of Microsoft?”</p>
<p>Matt and Kate and Ivan all nodded. “We know it,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“Judith’s father was an early investor. We have shares and—”</p>
<p>“Shares! How much do you have in cash?” Ma demanded. “Here in Australia?”</p>
<p>“Just a few hundred dollars in Australia,” Tom admitted.</p>
<p>“But we can get more here tomorrow by bank transfer from America,” Heather added.</p>
<p>“I was coming to that. We can get money transferred here from America quite easily. A lot of money.”</p>
<p>“How much?” Ma asked.</p>
<p>Tom leaned back on his heels. Everyone was looking at him. Moths were flying into the bright lights. The stars were coming out. The air was getting cooler. Temperatures were cooling—both literally and in terms of the mood. He had convinced them with common sense and calm talking. The thing they didn’t teach you in medical school, how to talk to patients, was one of the most important skills to learn.</p>
<p>He had this under control.</p>
<p>Money was the key. They had moved from wanting revenge to wanting money. Tom knew he had to pick the right amount – not too much, not too little. Not too much to seem unbelievable, but not too little either. “Five hundred thousand dollars. U.S. dollars,” he said.</p>
<p>A few sounds of surprise went through the crowd.</p>
<p>“Half a million dollars?” Kate said doubtfully.</p>
<p>“I have that in my account, yes,” Tom insisted.</p>
<p>“How does the transfer work?” an older woman in dirty blue jeans and a ripped top asked. She also had a gun, an old-looking rifle that she was using as a walking stick.</p>
<p>“Yeah, how—how is that supposed to work?” Ivan demanded.</p>
<p>“It’s in a checking account in America. I have more in a savings account, but I can transfer everything from the checking account without causing any suspicion,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s nonsense,” Kate said.</p>
<p>“How is it nonsense?” Matt asked.</p>
<p>“If we let them go to Melbourne to get the money, we’ll never hear from any of them again,” Kate said.</p>
<p>More quiet talking.</p>
<p>“We keep the children here. He goes and gets the half a million in cash and brings it back. And we exchange the money for the kids. A hundred thousand to Danny as payment for his loss, the rest split between us,” Matt said and looked at Ma for her approval.</p>
<p>“A hundred thousand for a dead wife!” Kate said.</p>
<p>“Well, like me, she wasn’t family, was she?” Matt said.</p>
<p>There was some laughter from the crowd. Tom saw that the mood was changing. They were becoming more reasonable. “I think that’s fair,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“It might be. Ellen’s only been here a year,” Ma agreed.</p>
<p>“No! The kids can’t stay here as hostages. They’ll be terrified. Tom takes the kids with him and I stay here and he—” Heather began but Tom interrupted.</p>
<p>“For God’s sake, Heather! I can handle this, honey. It’ll be OK. Maybe I could take Olivia with me to help sort things out. You’ll be here to look after Owen. I’ll get the cash from the bank and be back this time tomorrow. Everything will be fine. Then we can all go home. We can get this done,” Tom said.</p>
<p>Her brow wrinkled and then she nodded. “OK.”</p>
<p>Ma also gave him a nod.</p>
<p>He began to relax a little bit. This might actually work.</p>
<p>“How do we know he’s good for the money? That’s a lot of money,” Kate said.</p>
<p>“Americans are rich!” someone else said.</p>
<p>“Look at his car, you idiot. It’s a Porsche, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I’m good for the money,” Tom insisted over the rising noise.</p>
<p>Ma nudged Ivan next to her. He lifted the pistol and fired it into the air.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately became quiet. In the silence Tom could hear Heather crying softly.</p>
<p>“Right! Now that I have everyone’s attention,” Ma said. “First, Dr. Thomas Baxter, if you come back with the police, you will never see your wife or little boy again. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“I completely understand,” Tom replied.</p>
<p>“We will have taken them to another place.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>“Second, if you come with one dollar less than five hundred thousand, the deal is off.”</p>
<p>“I won’t. I’ll bring exactly that amount.”</p>
<p>“Third, if, after you’ve all gone back to America, the police come up here asking questions about missing money, you better watch out, mate. Because we will tell the police about what you did, and that will only be the start of it. We’re a big family. One of us will get to America and find you.”</p>
<p>“I won’t break the deal. This is what I wanted to do from the very beginning. I know I did something wrong. I know there’s nothing I can do to change that. But I would have done this even if you weren’t keeping my wife and son…as…” His voice faded. He didn’t want to say the word hostages. This was a very sensitive situation, and he didn’t want to make things worse by using words that could cause anger. “As your guests,” he said.</p>
<p>Heather was worried. She was normally so calm; that was part of the reason he’d been attracted to her in the first place. She was the opposite of Judith in many ways. In the year he’d known her, she hadn’t often lost her temper, but these were very unusual circumstances. He could not afford to let her ruin it now.</p>
<p>“It’ll be OK, Heather, trust me,” he said softly. “Look at me, honey. Look at me. Trust me. This will work. Take a deep breath. Come on.”</p>
<p>She took a breath and nodded. “You’ll come back with the money?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“And you’ll make them give us food and water?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>In the distance Tom could hear the sound of a motorbike.</p>
<p>“That’ll be Danny coming,” Matt said. “Do we have a deal?”</p>
<p>“We do from me,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“From us too,” Ma said. “We’re reasonable people, Dr. Baxter. We live here by ourselves. We don’t harm anyone. We don’t invite people to our island, but if they come, police or government, we expect them to be respectful.”</p>
<p>“Of course. We made the mistake and I’m very sorry about it.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t want any of this—” Ma said.</p>
<p>“Sorry to interrupt, Ma, but we have another problem,” Jacko said.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Ma asked.</p>
<p>“We found the Germans and we’re keeping them at the house, but they really want to go,” Jacko said.</p>
<p>“Tell them the ferry needs fixing,” Ma said.</p>
<p>“Got it,” Jacko said.</p>
<p>“Any other problems I have to solve?” Ma said and took a long puff of her cigarette.</p>
<p>“The children can’t possibly stay in that room overnight. You’ll have to move them,” Heather said.</p>
<p>Oh no. We’ve won this. Don’t cause any trouble, Tom was thinking strongly at her.</p>
<p>Heather surprisingly seemed to understand what he was thinking. “Well, at the very least, we’ll need some bedding and something to eat and drink, and you’ll have to let us use the bathroom, otherwise it’s going to be very unpleasant in there,” Heather said.</p>
<p>The motorbike was very close now. It was driving up to the farm. Everything was quiet, waiting.</p>
<p>A line of clouds.</p>
<p>The silent stars.</p>
<p>The silent yellow crescent moon.</p>
<p>“Danny’s going to lose his temper,” Jacko muttered.</p>
<p>“We’ve had our talk and we made a deal,” Matt said. “Danny’s going to have to accept it.”</p>
<p>“Yup,” Ivan agreed. “Like Matt said, she wasn’t family.”</p>
<p>The motorbike stopped in front of the farmhouse.</p>
<p>The strange quiet grew deeper.</p>
<p>Flies.</p>
<p>Moths.</p>
<p>Empty space.</p>
<p>Nothingness.</p>
<p>Everyone waiting.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a scream. “I think they told him,” Kate said.</p>
<p>“You might be right about that, Katie,” Jacko said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>There was the sound of a struggle, and the door to the farmhouse burst open with a bright silver light.</p>
<p>There was a terrible cry, like a dog dying.</p>
<p>The sound of arguing.</p>
<p>Then silence.</p>
<p>A shape in the doorway.</p>
<p>Danny was carrying Ellen’s body in his arms.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” Matt whispered. “Jacko, be ready for him to do something stupid.”</p>
<p>Danny carried Ellen into the farmyard. Like all the O’Neills, he was tall and thin. He had thinning red hair and dark eyes.</p>
<p>He looked at Tom. “Is he the one?” he asked Ma, saying the words angrily.</p>
<p>“Take it easy, mate, we’ve fixed this,” Jacko said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, they told me what you fixed,” Danny said. “You think I’m going to take your dirty money? You think I’m going to take one cent of that? For her?”</p>
<p>Danny set Ellen gently on the ground. She was like a rag doll, broken in many places. Danny gently touched her face, shaking. “She was everything. She was better than all of you put together, and you know it!” Danny said.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. I really am,” Tom said. He meant it. That poor woman. It was awful. But…but that wasn’t the problem now. The problem was what to do next.</p>
<p>Danny stood. His eyes were red and empty. He pointed a finger at Tom. “You killed her!”</p>
<p>Tom nodded. “It was an accident. And I’m sorry. But I—I take full responsibility.”</p>
<p>“That’s not enough!” Danny yelled.</p>
<p>“Calm down, mate. We’ve agreed. You missed the meeting. We all agreed and Ma decided,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“Did you decide, Ma? Without me?” Danny said in a flat, distant voice.</p>
<p>“I did. We decided. It’s for the best,” Ma replied firmly.</p>
<p>Danny walked over to Tom and poked him in the chest.</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry,” Tom said softly.</p>
<p>“Sorry, are you? Sorry!” Danny’s face was twisted with rage and sadness. His eyes were narrow with dark anger. Spit ran down his chin. “And you’ve agreed, have you?” Danny said, still poking Tom in the chest. “This rich guy runs over my Ellen, an innocent person who wouldn’t harm anyone. All I have in the world. And you’ve agreed that we don’t do anything about it?”</p>
<p>“I’m really upset by what’s happened. She just came out of nowhere, I—” Tom began. Danny shoved him hard in the chest. Tom tripped over his own feet and fell. Danny tried to kick him, but Matt wrapped Danny up in his big arms and lifted him off the ground.</p>
<p>“Ma made the decision, mate!” Matt said.</p>
<p>Tom carefully got to his feet.</p>
<p>“You can’t decide anything without me!” Danny screamed. “Look at her! Look what he did to her! She was beautiful. She was all I had. What am I going to do?”</p>
<p>“Mate, calm down, it’s going to be all right,” Matt insisted.</p>
<p>“How! How is it?” Danny yelled. “What about his wife? What if I do something to her?”</p>
<p>“No. This has nothing to do with my wife. This has nothing to do with my family. I was driving the car. This is my responsibility,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“On you?”</p>
<p>“On me,” Tom said.</p>
<p>“Right, OK, OK, I understand,” Danny said, calmer now. “Put me down, Matt. It’s OK, put me down, mate.”</p>
<p>Matt carefully released his grip and Danny dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>“Nothing can bring back Ellen. Nothing. This is what’s for the best,” Matt said.</p>
<p>“I understand,” Danny said. “I went out and got a job and got a wife. And you lot do nothing but sit here smoking and complaining and drinking in your sweatpants. And you awful people are deciding for me?”</p>
<p>He went back to Ellen’s body and kissed her and held her. He took something out of his pocket. A cross, Tom thought, as he saw it shine in the moonlight.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t a cross, it was a…</p>
<p>“Look out!” Heather yelled as Danny turned, ran at Tom, and stabbed the knife into him with such force that it nearly knocked him off his feet.</p>
<p>Heather screamed.</p>
<p>“Huhh,” Tom said as the knife went deep into his right side.</p>
<p>“Wow! What have you done!” Tom heard Matt yelling.</p>
<p>“He got what he deserved,” Danny yelled back.</p>
<p>Danny pulled back the knife to stab Tom again. Before he could do it, Heather was on his back, trying hard to get her tied hands around his throat.</p>
<p>She has fight in her, that one, Tom thought as his legs gave way and he fell to the ground like a broken puppet.</p>
<p>The ground was warm. It felt comforting.</p>
<p>From here, he could see feet and the sides of farm buildings.</p>
<p>Heather was a tiny little thing, and Danny was, by comparison, a big man. It wasn’t a fair fight, but Ivan and Matt were stepping in.</p>
<p>“You awful person!” Ivan was saying.</p>
<p>Danny was yelling something back.</p>
<p>The voices were fading. Everything was fading.</p>
<p>The fields.</p>
<p>The falling stars.</p>
<p>The crescent moon disappearing into mist above the Earth.</p>
<p>His eyes felt heavy.</p>
<p>Four thoughts went through his fading mind. Four thoughts that were four words:</p>
<p>Judith.</p>
<p>Heather.</p>
<p>Olivia.</p>
<p>Owen.</p>
<p>He tried to focus on the present, but it was so hard; the present kept slipping away.</p>
<p>He felt a sudden feeling of worry, anxiety, fear.</p>
<p>Regrets.</p>
<p>Mistakes.</p>
<p>The day was cooling.</p>
<p>The earth was warm.</p>
<p>When he closed his eyes, the world disappeared completely.</p>
<p>He couldn’t feel his fingertips.</p>
<p>He couldn’t feel his legs.</p>
<p>And then there was no 'he' to feel anything at all.</p>
